            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT is the Misfortune of our times to have Religion at once aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted by a Rude and Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Profaneneſs, by a Confident pretence to reaſon, and by Sceptical
<pb facs="tcp:93273:3"/>
Sophiſtry. Its Foundations are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack'd by the Profeſs'd Enemies of God and Goodneſs: Its Myſteries are Ridicul'd by Hereticks, as if they intended to invite Atheiſts to their Aſſiſtance, to joyn a Helping Hand to the Carrying on ſo Good a Work, as the Expoſing Religion, and making it appear Abſurd and Contemptible. And as if it were not Task enough to Encounter Open Enemies, it hath the Hard Fate of it's Bleſſed Author to be <hi>Wounded in the Houſe of it's Friends:</hi> whileſt many of thoſe who ſeem to Embrace it, are much more Induſtrious to Raiſe Doubts and Scruples about it, than to Eſtabliſh the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Truths of it; or elſe lay down ſuch Looſe Principles, that Wicked Men may deduce their own Concluſions from them, and
<pb facs="tcp:93273:3"/>
can't but pleaſe themſelves to ſee their Work done to their Hands, and Chriſtianity Undermin'd by the Imprudence or Treachery of it's own Votaries. Thus by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees Men have proceeded from Arguing about Obſcure and Nice Matters to queſtion Known and Certain Truths; and from Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting about the <hi>Points</hi> and <hi>Tittles</hi> of the Law, to Reject the Divine Authority of the whole: from thence to Decry all Revelation, becauſe they cannot exactly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend how God's Spirit Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences and Cooperates with Man's Underſtanding: and at laſt to caſt off Religion in General. So True is that which a Great Man has Obſerv'd, <q>That the Diſeſteem of the Scriptures is the Decay of Religion, and through many Turnings and Windings at laſt
<pb facs="tcp:93273:4"/>
leads Men into the very Depth of Atheiſm.</q>
            </p>
            <p>My LORD, The Deſign of the Letters which I have Undertaken to Anſwer, is to Perplex Men's minds with Difficulties about the <hi>Nature of Inſpiration,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by render the Divine Authority of thoſe Writings ſuſpected, which the Church has always lookt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as the Sacred <hi>Depoſitum</hi> of Divine Truth, which God has committed to it's Truſt, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd for it's Guide and Oracle. When firſt I ſaw this Treatiſe turn'd into Engliſh, I was in Hopes that ſome of our Eminent Divines, whoſe Writings are ſo Deſervedly Admir'd for their Strength and Clearneſs, would have Vindicated the Authority of the Scriptures, and Clear'd their Title to Inſpiration from thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:93273:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Difficulties with which Men that are Better at Pulling down than Building up, have perplexed it. The Subject has never yet been throughly Handled, and is Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the Thoughts of thoſe Great Maſters of Learning, Reaſon and Judgement. But after I had wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome time, and could not hear that any Abler Perſon Intended to take this Work in hand, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to do my Beſt Endeavour toward the Defence of ſo Good a Cauſe, and give a Check to thoſe Opinions which tend to Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine all Revelation. And when I had finiſhed my Deſign, there were many Conſiderations moved me to preſent it to your Lordſhip: not doubting but your Known Candor and Goodneſs would par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the Confidence of this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs. Your Eminent Dignity in

And as theſe Conſiderations Embolden'd me to Preſent this Treatiſe to your Lordſhip, which is writ in Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of thoſe Sacred Truths, for the Defence and Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which your Lordſhip is Placed in that High Station; ſo Your Signal Courage in Oppoſing the Enthuſiaſts of the <hi>Late Times,</hi> whoſe Vile Hypocriſy, and Lewd

Pretences to Inſpiration have made way for Open Profaneneſs and Contempt of all Revel'd Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, Encourages me to hope that your Lordſhip will favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably accept this Work, how mean ſoever, whoſe Deſign 'tis to put ſome ſtop to thoſe Laſting Ill-Effects which have proceeded from ſuch Pernicious Principles.

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Age we live in deſervedly bears the Character of a Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Inquiſitive Age, which does not love to take things upon Truſt, or blindly follow the Determinations of others. And I muſt profeſs for my own part, that I reckon a free uſe of Reaſoning and Judging, as Valuable a Bleſſing as the Injoyment of our Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Liberties, and look upon no ſort of Tyranny ſo grievous as that of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Perſons of Ingenuous and Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Tempers, exactly to ſquare their Sentiments of things to other mens Opinions. But as the Beſt things are liable to be abus'd, ſo this Freedom of Enquiry has been made uſe of to Ill Purpoſes, and has <hi>Accidentally</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
<pb facs="tcp:93273:7"/>
very bad Effects. For men have been ſo Fond of this Liberty, as to think no Bounds or Limits ought to be ſet to it, and at laſt to believe the Submitting to the Authority of God himſelf to be an undue Reſtraint up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Humane Reaſon: and the very pretending to ſuch an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to be one of the Arts of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning Prieſts,</hi> who by this Device endeavour to Enſlave the reſt of the World, and make them Think and Act juſt as they would have them. Thus many men have Reaſon'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves firſt into <hi>Socinianiſm,</hi> and then, which is but one Remove from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, into <hi>Deiſm,</hi> or at leaſt into a Cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Indifferency to all Reveal'd Religion. They think 'tis to Impoſe upon them to Oblige them to Believe or Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe any thing, unleſs they can ſee a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why it ſhould be ſo: and cannot be perſwaded that they owe God ſo much ſervice, as to ſubmit to thoſe Laws which ſeem to them to have no other ground but his Arbitrary Will and Pleaſure. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon this account they reject the <hi>Uſe</hi> of the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> the <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters</hi> and <hi>Church-Governours</hi> who
<pb facs="tcp:93273:7"/>
have the Power of Diſpenſing them: the Neceſſity of being <hi>Incorporated</hi> into the <hi>Church,</hi> as a <hi>Society Founded upon a Divine Charter,</hi> and to whoſe Members alone belong the Priviledges of the New Covenant: the <hi>Meritorious Efficacy</hi> of Chriſt's <hi>Sacrifice</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion</hi> towards the Procuring men's Salvation: theſe Doctrines, I ſay, they will by no means admit to be True, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as they pretend, they cannot ſee what Natural Force there is in theſe things toward their producing their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Effects. And when they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived Chriſt of his Titles of <hi>Saviour</hi> and <hi>High-Prieſt,</hi> tho perhaps they may ſtill be contented to acknowledge him a <hi>Prophet</hi> and a Teacher come from God, yet they look upon his Coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World as a matter of no Great Conſequence, and which men do well to believe, if they ſee good Reaſon for it: or if after having uſed <hi>Reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Diligence</hi> they are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd that 'tis True, there's no great Harm done; ſince he came only to Reinforce the Principles and Duties of Natural Religion, which men's Reaſon will ſufficiently inſtruct them
<pb facs="tcp:93273:8"/>
in: and if they do but live up to its Directions, and lead good Moral Lives they may be ſaved, whatever their Opinions are as to what they call the Speculative Points of Religion. Theſe Opinions every body is ſenſible are very much in Vogue, eſpecially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe who value themſelves for being Free Thinkers and Reaſoners. 'Tis evident likewiſe that men of theſe Principles are apt to look upon the <hi>Bible</hi> as a Book of no great Value, and which the World might very well be without: and are ready to declare that the Diſputes it has occaſion'd have done more harm than the Book has done good: and ſo from <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndervalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its Worth they come to queſtion its Authority.</p>
            <p>From what has been ſaid it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears very probable, that the Prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe Looſe Notions concerning a <hi>Church-ſtate</hi> and <hi>Revealed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> at firſt gave Riſe, or at leaſt hath ſince given Continuance to thoſe Controverſies, that have been ſo much Debated of late concerning the <hi>Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Scriptures.</hi> And the Atheiſtical Party have been
<pb facs="tcp:93273:8"/>
Induſtrious to keep alive this Diſpute, as well knowing that 'tis doing no ſmall piece of Service to their Cauſe, to weaken the Authority of the Holy Writings. Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> and the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> of <hi>Theologo-Politicus</hi> are the Chief of that Party who have engag'd in this Controverſie: tho indeed they ought to paſs but for one Writer, ſince the latter has taken the Subſtance of what he ſays from the former, and ſeems to have little of his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention; unleſs it be the Quoting of a Text now and then in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> which he does, I ſuppoſe, to raiſe in his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned Readers an Admiration of his Profound Reading and Schollar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. And this Deſign of his has in ſome meaſure taken Effect, for his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſtical Admirers are generally Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant enough to take him for a Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Senſe and Learning.</p>
            <p>But to paſs by theſe Profeſs'd Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates of Atheiſm and Irreligion: the moſt conſiderable Writers that have been concern'd in the Controverſie about the Integrity and Authority of the Holy Writings are Mr. <hi>Simon</hi> and his <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries.</hi> Whoſe Learning as I do

not intend to diſparage, ſo neither will I take upon me to judge of their Secret Intention in the Management of this Diſpute. I acknowledge them to be men of Learning, and as to their Deſign I am willing to think as Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritably as I can. But yet I cannot forbear ſaying, that tho they differ very much in their Notions as to other Matters, yet they ſeem to agree in ſpeaking ſlightly and irreverently of the Holy Writers: they readily lay hold of any Difficulties which tend to weaken their Credit, and do not take half ſo much pains to Improve any of the Arguments that may be produc'd for them, as they do to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rge Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions againſt them. But however, I muſt ſay thus much in behalf of Mr. <hi>Simon,</hi> that many, to ſhew their good Will to the Bible, make him ſay much Worſe things than he really does, and ſuch as they would fain have him ſay, and would be glad if they could Vouch his Authority for. They are Induſtrious to make the world believe, that if we will take his Judgment, there have been ſo many Corruptions and Alterations made in the Text of
<pb facs="tcp:93273:9"/>
the Bible, that 'tis impoſſible to tell which is the True and which is the Falſe Reading. Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in his <hi>Religio Laici,</hi> makes this Comment upon Mr. <hi>Simon</hi>'s <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,</hi> and tells us, as delivering that Author's ſenſe, that the Jews have
<q>
                  <l>Let in Groſs Errors to corrupt the Text,</l>
                  <l>Omitted Paragrahs, — <hi>and</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>With vain Traditions ſtop'd the Gaping Fence.</l>
               </q>
Now one would think by this Account of his Work, that Mr. <hi>Simon</hi> had expreſly aſſerted that the Jews had Wilfully and Deſignedly Corrupted the Original, by Adding to and Taking away from it as they thought fit. But in my Opinion 'tis taking a greater Liberty than <hi>Poetry</hi> it ſelf will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, to make a man ſpeak quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his Senſe and Meaning. For Mr. <hi>Simon</hi> makes it his Buſineſs to prove in ſeveral places of his Book<note n="a" place="margin">Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the O. T. l. 1. ch. 17, 18, 19 l. 2. c. 4.</note>, that the Jews have not corrupted the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text, and anſwers the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments that are uſually brought for that Opinion. All that he affirms as to this matter is, that the Bible has
<pb facs="tcp:93273:10"/>
been obnoxious to the ſame Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that other Books are, through the Ignorance or Negligence of Tranſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; and that ſuch kind of Faults crept into the Text in thoſe Ages chiefly that did not mind the Niceties of Criticiſm: and therefore the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per way to Reform thoſe Errors is by Correcting the Suſpected Places ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Rules of that Art, and by diligent Comparing of Copies, as Criticks correct other Books, and the <hi>Maſſorets</hi> have already the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text. And as for the Additions which are ſuppoſed by many to have been made to the Original Text, he ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes them inſerted by Prophets, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there was a conſtant Succeſſion, whoſe Buſineſs 'twas to take Care of the Publick Records. How true this <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> is, 'tis not my Buſineſs to examine, 'tis ſufficient to my preſent Purpoſe, that Mr. <hi>Simon</hi> does not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent theſe Additions as ſo many Corruptions of the Text. So that in this Caſe Mr. <hi>D.</hi> has Miſrepreſented Mr. <hi>Simon</hi>'s Text, aſwell as that of the Bible: and put ſuch a Gloſs upon it, as it does not appear that he ever
<pb facs="tcp:93273:10"/>
intended, as far as can be gathered from his Words. But I ſhall purſue this Matter no further, becauſe Mr. <hi>D.</hi> may think it hard meaſure to urge any thing ſaid in his <hi>Religio Laici</hi> againſt him at this time of day, when he has alter'd his Mind in ſo many Particulars ſince the Writing of that Poem, and has made Amends for his Former Incredulity by turning Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate for <hi>Implicite Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One of Mr. <hi>Simon</hi>'s Antagoniſts, whom he and the reſt of the World take to be Mr. <hi>Le Clerc,</hi> publiſh'd thoſe <hi>Letters</hi> which I have underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to anſwer: the Two Firſt of them in his <hi>Sentimens de Theologiens de Hollande ſur l' Hiſtoire Critique,</hi> &amp;c. the Reſt in the <hi>Defence</hi> of the <hi>Sentiments.</hi> Who is the Author of theſe Letters, whether Mr. <hi>Le Clerc</hi> himſelf, or as he pretends, a Friend of his whom he calls Mr. <hi>N.</hi> ſignifies little to the Controverſie it ſelf, and therefore I do not think it worth while to enquire. And as to the Author's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign in writing theſe Tracts, whether they were writ by way of Enquiry on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or out of a Deſign to undermine
<pb facs="tcp:93273:11"/>
the Authority of the Scriptures, I ſhall not take upon me to Determine, but ſhall leave that to the <hi>Searcher of Hearts.</hi> Charity that <hi>believes all things,</hi> prompts me to believe the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's ſolemn Proteſtation which he makes<note n="b" place="margin">Eng. Ed. p. 38. French p. 229.</note>, that he diſowns the ill Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences which ſome have drawn from his Principles: and his Arguments for the Chriſtian Religion which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in the <hi>Laſt Letter,</hi> incourage me to perſiſt in that Chriſtian Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion. However when I found the Author earneſtly deſirous<note n="c" place="margin">Fr. p. 245. Eng. p. 51.</note> that ſome body would fairly anſwer him, and indeavour to give further Light to this Matter: and withall was ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that he has laid down ſeveral Aſſertions, which tend to leſſen the Authority and Credit of the Sacred Writers, and that Ill men have made uſe of them to this purpoſe, as 'tis their conſtant Method to run away with any thing that ſeems to favour their ſide, but to overlook what makes againſt them: all theſe Conſiderations perſwaded me to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertake a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Examination of all thoſe Paſſages in theſe Letters, that reflect upon the
<pb facs="tcp:93273:11"/>
Holy Pen-men or their Writings.</p>
            <p>I know Mr. <hi>Simon</hi> has made a brief Anſwer to all the Material Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this Author: the Subſtance of which is inſerted in the <hi>Fourth Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> together with Mr. <hi>N</hi>'s Reply. But I muſt freely profeſs, I am not at all ſatisfied with Mr. <hi>Simon</hi>'s Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, and his Anſwers ſeem to have been drawn up in Haſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a thorow Examination of the Force of the Objections. Perhaps Mr. <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> is not ſo well vers'd in the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilties of Reaſoning, as he is in the Nicities of Criticiſm. And indeed <hi>Both</hi> his <hi>Anſwers</hi> to Mr. <hi>Le Clerc</hi> diſcover as much: where he ſpends moſt of his time in Railing againſt the Proteſtants, which might much better have been imployed in Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating his own Principles from his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries Objections, or Defending thoſe Common Truths in which the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity both of Proteſtants and Papiſts agree, tho neither he nor his Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſeem to have any great regard for them. But this is the uſual Fault of ſuch Zealots, as Mr. <hi>Simon</hi> hath <hi>of late</hi> diſcover'd himſelf to be, that they are
<pb facs="tcp:93273:12"/>
more concern'd for the particular Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of their own Party, than for the Fundamental Articles of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Chriſtianity: and therefore they very often advance ſuch Arguments in Defence of their own particular Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, which if they are purſued fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, undermine the Foundation of Chriſtianity it ſelf, or it may be of Religion in General. Of which Mr. <hi>Simon</hi> himſelf is an Inſtance, who has taken a great deal of Pains to weaken the Authority of the Scripture Text, on purpoſe to ſet up the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of Tradition in its place. But I believe another Reaſon may be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd of Mr. <hi>Simon</hi>'s Fierceneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Proteſtants; and that is, becauſe he lives in a Country where Hereſy now-adays is reckon'd a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Crime than Infidelity, and 'tis leſs dangerous to be thought no Chriſtian than no Catholick. And conſequently it more nearly concern'd Mr. <hi>Simon,</hi> to clear himſelf from the Suſpicion of Hereſy, than to prove himſelf a good Chriſtian: tho perhaps in the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the World, he ſtands in need of an Apology in that reſpect, as much
<pb facs="tcp:93273:12"/>
as in the other. And perhaps he could not take a better Method, to atone for his Diſreſpect towards the Scriptures, and to regain the Favour of his Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours whoſe Diſpleaſure he has felt upon that Account, than by crying up in Oppoſition to them, the Infallibility of Tradition and the Authority of the Church, and Inveighing againſt the Proteſtants with a great deal of Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs and Virulency.</p>
            <p>And ſince Mr. <hi>Simon</hi>'s Anſwer gives ſo little ſatisfaction to the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties which this Author has ſtarted concerning the Inſpiration of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, I thought it might be an uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thing to examine the Subſtance of theſe Letters over again, and Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the holy Writings from this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's Objections. I muſt leave it to the Reader to judge of the Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance. All I ſhall ſay for my ſelf is, That I have manag'd the Diſpute with all the Calmneſs, and Freedom from Paſſion, which becomes an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Searcher after Truth: and in that reſpect I hope I have fully ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the Deſire of my Antagoniſt<note n="d" place="margin">Fr. <hi>p.</hi> 245. Eng. p. 51.</note>.</p>
            <p>I have kept my ſelf cloſe to his main
<pb facs="tcp:93273:13"/>
Deſign: which is not to queſtion the Veracity of the Holy Writers, or the Truth of the Doctrine or Matters of Fact which they deliver, but only to propoſe ſome Doubts and Queſtions, How far they were Inſpir'd either with the Matter or Words which they writ. So that in this Diſcourſe men muſt not expect I ſhould handle all the Arguments for the Truth of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures and the Chriſtian Religion, which are proper to be alledg'd a-againſt Atheiſts and Infidels. This as 'tis forreign to the preſent Deſign, ſo it has been done ſo Often and ſo Fully by ſeveral Learned men, and amongſt others by this very Author in his <hi>Fifth Letter,</hi> that nothing more need or can be ſaid upon this Subject. And if men will ſtill ſhut their eyes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all Conviction, we muſt e'en deſpair of doing any good upon them, and can only ſay to them in the words of the Apoſtle, <hi>He that is ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, let him be ignorant:</hi> and <hi>If our Goſpel be hid, 'tis hid to them that are loſt, whoſe minds the God of this world hath blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</hi> However to do what Service
<pb facs="tcp:93273:13"/>
I am able to the Cauſe of Religion, and to make this Diſcourſe as uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as I can, I have ventur'd to go a little beyond the Bounds which my Adverſary hath ſet me, and have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd briefly to explain the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Deſign of the <hi>Prophetical Writings:</hi> where I have diſcours'd upon ſome things not commonly trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of, the Explaining of which I hope may tend to Illuſtrate that noble part of the Scripture, and remove ſome Prejudices againſt the Authority of the Prophets, which have been greedily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd by ſuch perſons as are apt to be unreaſonably Suſpicious and Jealous of being Impos'd upon, and becauſe there have been <hi>Falſe Prophets,</hi> think 'tis impoſſible there ſhould be <hi>True</hi> ones.</p>
            <p>If I have been guilty of any Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes, I hope the Reader will the more eaſily pardon them, when he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders the Niceneſs of the Subject, and that it has never yet been purpoſely treated of by any Writer that I know, as our Author himſelf obſerves<note n="e" place="margin">Ubi ſup.</note>: ſo that, as he truly adds, <hi>A man muſt fetch all out of his own Stock that intends to Anſwer him.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb facs="tcp:93273:14"/>
if this Diſcourſe do not prove ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory, I hope 'twill be the occaſion of Engaging ſome Abler Pen in this Cauſe, and if that be the only Good it does, it will not be altogether <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable.</p>
            <p>In the laſt place, I muſt deſire of thoſe who think I have not carried the <hi>Inſpiration</hi> of the <hi>Scriptures</hi> ſo high as I ought, not to be Angry with me, or uncharitably Cenſure me, as if I deſign'd to Betray the Cauſe which I pretend to maintain: but if they are not ſatisfied with my Performance, to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertake the Argument them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and do Juſtice to ſo Good a Cauſa. I aſſure them I ſhall hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily wiſh them Succeſs in their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, and ſhall be glad if my Arguments appear <hi>weak</hi> becauſe theirs are <hi>ſtronger;</hi> for <hi>I can do nothing againſt the Truth, but for the Truth.</hi>

And if the Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Writings of the New Teſtament be once proved, that of the Old muſt follow as a neceſſary Conſequence; becauſe the former gives Teſtimony to the latter, and moſt of the Arguments which prove the one, may be eaſily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the other.</p>
            <p>Mr. N. allowes the <hi>Hiſtories of the N. Teſtament to be exact and true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of the matter of Fact, but ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that there's no need of Inſpiration to Write a true Hiſtory</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">Fr. <hi>p.</hi> 231, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Engl. <hi>p.</hi> 28. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note>. He grants like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that the <hi>Apoſtolical Epiſtles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain nothing but what is conformable to the Doctrine of Chriſt; but yet that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles had no need of an extraordinary Inſpiration for Writing their Epiſtles</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">Fr. <hi>p.</hi> 282, 283. Eng. <hi>p.</hi> 112, 113.</note>. But all this while he takes no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93273:20"/>
that theſe Writings were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd by God for the Perpetual Uſe and Inſtruction of the Church, and to be a Rule of Chriſtian Faith to all Ages. Which one thing if it be made out, will prove their Divine Original, and ſufficiently diſtinguiſh them from all other Writings, purely Humane, where Providence cannot be ſuppoſed to have had ſuch an extraordinary Hand in the Compoſure: ſince it neither can be pretended that the Authors were the <hi>Immediate Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of God in publiſhing his Will, nor that their Works were deſign'd for ſo general a Uſe, as the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Univerſal Church.</p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore in the firſt place give a definition of an <hi>Inſpir'd Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi> and then prove that the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the New Teſtament are truly ſuch. <hi>An Inſpired Writing I take to be a Book that is writ by the Incitation, Direction and Aſſiſtance of God, and deſign'd by him for the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual uſe of the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Proof of the Inſpiration of the <hi>New-Teſtament-Writings,</hi> I ſhall
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93273:21"/>
compriſe in theſe following Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. <hi>God deſign'd to provide a means for the preſerving the Doctrine of Chriſt to the end of the World.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>II. <hi>This could not be done ſo well in any Ordinary way or Humane means, as by committing this Doctrine to Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>III. <hi>'Tis more reaſonable to ſuppoſe that God would make uſe of this way than any other, becauſe he made uſe of the ſame means before, for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Jewiſh Church.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>IV. <hi>He has actually made uſe of no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way for the conveying down the Chriſtian Doctrine, that can be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>V. <hi>The Apoſtles themſelves deſign'd their Writings for the Perpetual uſe of the Church, and lookt upon them of equal Authority in the Chriſtian Church, as the Writings of the Old Teſtament were in the Jewiſh.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>VI. <hi>The Age immediately after the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles lookt upon the Writings of the New Teſtament, as the ſtanding Rule of Faith to the Chriſtian Church.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:93273:21"/>I think the making out theſe Propoſitions, (ſome of which need very little proof) will fully prove the Divine Authority of the Books contain'd in the Canon of the New Teſtament: and when they are made out, ſuch Conſequences may be drawn from them, as will ſilence moſt of the Cavils and Objections, which the <hi>Author of theſe Letters</hi> and ſome others have raiſed againſt the Inſpiration of the Scripture.</p>
            <p n="1">I. The firſt Propoſition to be proved is this: <hi>God deſign'd to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide a means for the preſerving the Doctrine of Chriſt, to the end of the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Propoſition I think any Chriſtian will take for granted: and my deſign at preſent is not to diſpute with <hi>Infidels,</hi> but to lay down thoſe Principles upon which the Divine Authority of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures is built, the truth of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity being preſuppoſed: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Author I am to deal with profeſſes the Belief of Chriſtianity, and yet has raiſed Objections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a great many of thoſe Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93273:22"/>
which Chriſtians have all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long lookt upon to be of Divine Authority. I ſay therefore that no Chriſtian can doubt of the truth of this Propoſition: for every Chriſtian believes the Goſpel to be the laſt and moſt perfect Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Will of God which he intends to afford to the World: he believes that <hi>Chriſt will be with his Church to the end of the World,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 28.20 —16.18.</note> 
               <hi>and that the gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it:</hi> i. e. it ſhall never be ſo far weakned, as that the Profeſſion of Chriſtianity ſhould ceaſe, or the Church be perfectly deprived of the Knowledge of ſaving Truth. Nothing further being needful for the illuſtrating this Propoſition, I proceed to the</p>
            <p n="2">II. Propoſition. <hi>God could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Knowledge of Chriſtianity in an Ordinary way, or by any Humane means ſo well, as by conveying the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of it to after Ages by Writing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do not pretend to preſcribe to God Almighty what method he ſhall uſe to diſcover his Will to the World, or confine him to any one
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93273:22"/>
way of doing it: but thus much I think I may ſafely ſay, that a <hi>ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Rule of Faith</hi> committed to Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting is liable to leſs inconveniencies and difficulties, than any other way of conveying down Divine Truth. Whereas all other ways that can be aſſign'd of tranſmitting Divine Revelation are incumbred with ſo many difficulties, that without a conſtant ſeries of Miracles, they can never attain their end. And therefore we can't reaſonably ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that God will make choice of any ſuch methods to Reveal his Will by. For this is to be laid down for a certain truth, that <hi>God never works more Miracles than needs muſt,</hi> nor ever ſuſpends or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bears the force of natural Agents without evident neceſſity, but all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways uſes ſecond Cauſes and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane means as far as they will go. And therefore that method which offers leaſt violence to Nature, is more likely to be made choice of by God. Some Men indeed are apt to think that the Hand of God can't ſhew it ſelf without a conſtant
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93273:23"/>
ſeries of Miracles: but they that conſider things more exactly, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther judge that a continued ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Miracles would really be a reproach to God's Ordinary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence: for often to interrupt the courſe of Nature, muſt needs be a reflection upon the Wiſdom that firſt contrived it. We can imagine but two ways of God's Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating his Will to ſeveral ſucceſſive Ages without the help of Writing; either <hi>Oral Tradition,</hi> or making a <hi>Particular Revelation</hi> to every ſingle Perſon, or at leaſt to all thoſe whoſe buſineſs 'tis to teach and inſtruct others in their Duty. Now both theſe ways are liable to ſuch diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and do ſuppoſe ſo many immediate interpoſitions of God's Power to prevent thoſe errors which muſt of neceſſity attend them, (conſidering the preſent ſtate of Humane Nature) as are not ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the methods which God uſes in Governing the World. I ſhall not purſue this matter any further, nor give a particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the inconveniencies to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:93273:23"/>
which both theſe Methods are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious, and to correct which a conſtant Interpoſition of Miracles will be neceſſary. The Abſurdity of the former has bin abundantly demonſtrated by the<note n="e" place="margin">Dr. <hi>Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotſon</hi>'s Rule of Faith. Dr. <hi>Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfl.</hi> Defence of A. B. <hi>Laud.</hi> Dr. <hi>Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Faith.</note> Learned De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders of the <hi>Proteſtant Reſolution of Faith,</hi> againſt thoſe Popiſh Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that ſet up Tradition in Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to it: and the Abſurdity of the latter is evident at firſt ſight, and none but meer Enthuſiaſts ever made any Pretence to it. But on the other ſide, for God to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate his Will by Writing, implies nothing in it but what is Natural and Eaſie: there is nothing requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to continue this to Poſterity, but God's preſerving the Writings themſelves by the ordinary Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of Providence: and then men may as well learn his Will from thence, as they can know the <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories</hi> of former Ages, the Opinions of <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> the <hi>Laws</hi> of their own and other Countries, from the Writings which record each of theſe particulars: unleſs we will ſay, that God cannot order a Book
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:93273:24"/>
to be writ in as Intelligible a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as men can indite it when they are left to themſelves.</p>
            <p>But 'twill further appear that 'tis more reaſonable to ſuppoſe that God ſhould preſerve the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſtianity by appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a written Rule of Faith, than by any other means, if we conſider,</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>That he made uſe of the ſame means formerly for the Inſtruction of the Jewiſh Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With God is no <hi>variableneſs,</hi> and what he once approves of, he does not afterward lay aſide, but upon ſome great reaſon. Moſes <hi>wrote his Law in a book</hi> by God's direction<note n="e" place="margin">Exod. 34.27.</note>: the Prophets appeal <hi>to the Law and to the Teſtimony</hi>
               <note n="f" place="margin">Iſ. 8.20.</note>, as the only ſafe Guide, and by which men muſt judge whether a Doctrine come from God, or not. Our Saviour bids the Jews<note n="g" place="margin">Joh. 5.39.</note> 
               <hi>ſearch the Scriptures, for in them they were perſwaded,</hi> and ſo far they were in the right, <hi>was contain'd the way to Eternal Life:</hi> and in all his Conteſts with the Jews, he deſired no other Vouchers for the Truth of what he ſaid but <hi>Moſes</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:93273:24"/>
and the <hi>Prophets.</hi> And 'twill appear very reaſonable to believe that God ſhould uſe the ſame Method to inſtruct the Chriſtian Church which he did the Jewiſh, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that our Saviour and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles conform'd the <hi>External</hi> parts of their Religion, to the Cuſtoms received among the Jews as much as they could, being reſolv'd to give no offence by ſtudiouſly affecting Novelties. The Two <hi>Sacraments</hi> were taken from Jewiſh Rites: the <hi>Government</hi> of the Chriſtian Church was framed after the Pattern of the Jewiſh <hi>Hierarchy:</hi> the Apoſtles, as 'tis natural for all men to do, being willing to retain the Cuſtoms they had been bred up in, wherever the Nature of Chriſtiany did not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige them to the contrary. From whence 'tis natural to ſuppoſe that the Apoſtles ſhould take care be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they left the world, to provide ſome certain means of Inſtruction for the Chriſtian Church, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the Jewiſh, which might ſupply their place when they were dead and gone: or elſe they would
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93273:25"/>
not have been ſo faithful in their office as <hi>Moſes</hi> was, <hi>who delivered the Book of the Law to the Prieſts before his Deceaſe</hi>
               <note n="h" place="margin">Deut. 31 9, 26.</note>. And 'tis likely the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians themſelves would expect to be provided with as good and ſufficient means of knowing their duty, as the Jews enjoyed, or elſe they would have had juſt cauſe to complain that they came behind them in the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of Knowledge and Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. And that this is not a meer Conjecture, but the real Senſe of the firſt Chriſtians, is plain from the Account which the Ancient Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters give us of the occaſion of St. <hi>Matthew</hi> and S. <hi>Mark</hi>'s writing their <hi>Goſpels. Euſebius</hi> tells us,<note n="i" place="margin">
                  <hi>H. E.</hi> l. 3. c. 24.</note> that St. Matthew <hi>wrote his Goſpel particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the uſe of the Jews to whom he had preached, becauſe going into other parts he would ſupply the Want of his Preſence by Writing. Clemens A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandrinus</hi> ſaies,<note n="k" place="margin">Ap <hi>Euſ. H. E.</hi> l. 2. c. 15.</note> 
               <hi>That</hi> St. Mark <hi>wrote his Goſpel at the Requeſt of the Chriſtians at Rome, who were not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with an unwritten Tradition of the Word, and therefore deſir'd him to commit it to Writing. Which St.</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:93273:25"/>
Peter <hi>coming to underſtand, approved and confirmed this Goſpel for the uſe of the Church.</hi> And when theſe and the other Apoſtolical Writings came into the hands of Chriſtians, there was no need of a particular Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand from God to make them be received as the Rule of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Faith. For the Character of the Perſons who wrote them, the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the Jewiſh Church, and the Parity of Reaſon why theſe Writings ſhould be of equal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority among Chriſtians, as the Writings of the Old Teſtament were among the Jews: and laſtly the Neceſſity of having ſome Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and Settled Rule of Faith: theſe were all ſufficient Induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to Chriſtians to look upon the Apoſtolical Writings as ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God, for the Perpetual Uſe and Inſtruction of the Church. And this will further appear if we conſider,</p>
            <p n="4">IV. <hi>That God has actually made uſe of no other way for the conveying down the Doctrine of Chriſtianity, that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93273:26"/>
can be aſſign'd, but the Writings of the N. Teſtament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis a very weak Argument to infer that things muſt be ſo, becauſe we think it Convenient they ſhould be ſo. This is indeed to preſcribe to God Almighty, and tell him he ought to have ask'd our Advice in the Managing of things. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, tho the Arguments for the Infallibility of <hi>Tradition,</hi> for an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Judge</hi> of <hi>Controverſies,</hi> or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever other Guide men have ſet up in oppoſition to the Scriptures, were never ſo plauſible, and were as real Demonſtrations as the Authors of them fancy them to be, yet as long as 'tis plain by Experience that <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> is not <hi>Infallible,</hi> and that there is no <hi>Infallible Judge</hi> of <hi>Controverſies,</hi> all theſe Pretences to Demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſignify nothing, for a man may demonſtrate his heart out, before he will be able to confute Experience. And that neither the Authority of the Church <hi>Repreſentative,</hi> nor the Tradition of the Church <hi>Diffuſive,</hi> neither Pope nor Council, jointly or ſeparately, are Infallible Guides
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:93273:26"/>
to Chriſtians, or equivalent to the Scriptures, has been made out with ſuch admirable Clearneſs, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerable Strength of Reaſon, by the Learned Defenders of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi> Cauſe againſt <hi>Popery,</hi> that without further inſiſting upon this Point, I ſhall refer to them for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Satisfaction, and proceed to the</p>
            <p n="5">V. Propoſition. <hi>That the Apoſtles themſelves deſign'd their Writings for the Perpetual <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of the Church, and look'd upon them of Equal Authority with the Writings of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Supernatural Aſſiſtance which attended the Apoſtles in every thing of Moment, and tending to the Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Church, was ſo Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary: and even their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Judgment as men, was ſo Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right and void of all Self-intereſt and Corruption, that 'twill very much illuſtrate this matter, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what Judgment and Opinion they themſelves had of their own Writings.</p>
            <p>The very Deſign of the Goſpels
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93273:27"/>
ſhews that they were writ for the <hi>General <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> of the Church, to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord the Doctrine and Miracles of our Saviour, <hi>the Author and Fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſher of our Faith,</hi> whom all are to hear and obey. And tho it were ſome particular <hi>Emergency</hi> that might induce the Evangeliſts to ſet about this Work, which yet is to be look'd upon as a <hi>Providential Motion,</hi> yet the Goſpels themſelves not only anſwer that particular End which was the firſt Occaſion of their being writ, but are of General Uſe, and fitted to all Ages and times. We have already mention'd the Occaſion of St. <hi>Matthew</hi> and St. <hi>Mark's</hi> writing their Goſpels. St. <hi>Luke</hi> gives an<note n="l" place="margin">Luk. 1.1.</note> Account of his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking himſelf, the ſubſtance of which is, <q>That ſince many had written an Hiſtory of our Savior's Life and Actions, who wanted ſome Advantages of knowing the Particulars which he had, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf being exactly inform'd by thoſe who were Eye-witneſſes and Parties concern'd, ſet about a more accurate account of theſe Matters,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:93273:27"/>
to the end that every Chriſtian who will be at the pains to read it, might know the Certainty of thoſe things wherein he has been inſtructed.</q> It ſeems from hence that committing things to Writing, was in St. <hi>Lukes</hi> judgment the moſt certain means of Conveying the Knowledge of them to others.</p>
            <p>As for St. <hi>John,</hi> 'tis plain by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring his Goſpel with the other <hi>Three,</hi> that he had ſeen the Reſt and approved them,<note n="a" place="margin">V. <hi>Euſ.</hi> H. E. l. 3. c. 24</note> and therefore ſupplied what he thought fit, which the former Evangeliſts had omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: that ſo all of them together might be a <hi>Complete Account</hi> of all that Jeſus did and taught. And he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> himſelf tells us that his Deſign in writing his Goſpel was,<note n="b" place="margin">Joh. 20.31.</note> 
               <hi>That men might believe that Jeſus is Chriſt, and that believing they might have life thro' his Name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To proceed to the <hi>Epiſtles</hi> of the Apoſtles: it muſt be confeſs'd that many of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s were written up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the particular <hi>Exigencies</hi> of the Churches to which they are dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and were occaſion'd by ſome
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93273:28"/>
Diſputes that were proper to thoſe times: which may be thought an Argument that they were not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd for the General Uſe of the Church. But yet if we conſider that the Fundamental Doctrines of Chriſtianity are admirably illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated by them, and many of the more Myſterious parts of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Diſpenſation more fully trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of in them, than by Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, becauſe there were many things which the Apoſtles were not able to <hi>bear</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">Joh. 16.12.</note> while he was with them, and therefore they were referred to the Teaching of the Holy Ghoſt, for fuller Inſtruction in ſuch matters: I ſay if we lay theſe things toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we muſt acknowledge it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to add the Apoſtolical E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles to the Goſpels, in order to the making up a <hi>Complete Rule</hi> of Chriſtian Faith: or elſe we ſhall be much to ſeek for an <hi>Authentick</hi> Explication of ſeveral Important Points of Chriſtianity. But of this I ſhall diſcourſe more largely in the next Chapter. To return to S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles: I cannot but obſerve
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:93273:28"/>
how the Wiſdom of God has made St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Style and way of Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, to be admirably ſerviceable to the Edification of the Church, which yet if we examine it by the Rules of <hi>Criticiſm,</hi> is far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Regular</hi> and Exact. But his free uſe of <hi>Digreſſions,</hi> and thoſe long ones too ſometimes, opens him a way into a larger Subject and of more General Uſe, and does not ſuffer him to confine himſelf to that one particular Point, which 'twas his main Deſign to treat of. And when we find him take occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from every hint to explain the Myſteries of the Goſpel, to ſet forth the Excellency of it, and to perſwade men to live up to the Height of its Precepts, this is not only a ſign that his holy Soul was full of this noble Subject, but is likewiſe an argument that the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit Influenc'd his Pen, and made him enlarge himſelf upon thoſe Points which were of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Concern, and would be for the Perpetual Benefit of the Church in all ſucceeding Ages. A ſignal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93273:29"/>
of this you may ſee in that large <hi>Digreſſion</hi> in the <hi>ſecond Epiſtle to the Corinthians,</hi> which reaches from the 13. <hi>verſe</hi> of the <hi>Second Chapter,</hi> to the 5. <hi>verſe</hi> of the <hi>Seventh.</hi> Where he diſcourſes of ſome of the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals of Chriſtianity, with ſuch a true Spirit of Piety, and with ſuch a powerful Force of Natural Eloquence, that if we may prefer one part of that Inſpir'd Teacher's Writings before another, we might call this one of the moſt Elevated Diſcourſes in all St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles. And as both the Matter of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles, and the Manner how they are writ, diſcover to us that they were deſign'd for the Perpetual Uſe of Chriſtians, ſo we ſhall find St. <hi>Peter</hi> to have been of the ſame mind, whoſe words juſtify all that I have ſaid. For he places St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles in an equal Rank with thoſe holy Writings, which were on all hands agreed upon to be the Word of God. Thus much his words import, II. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15, 16. where ſpeaking of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles that there were ſome things

in them <hi>hard to be underſtood, which ignorant and unſtable men wreſted</hi> and applied to ill purpoſes, to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh corrupt Doctrines: he adds, <hi>As they do alſo the</hi> OTHER SCRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PTURES <hi>to their own deſtruction:</hi> which Expreſſion of <hi>[other Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures]</hi> plainly implies that St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> look'd upon St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles as part of the <hi>Canon</hi> of Scripture, and rank'd them among thoſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Writings which were deſign'd for our Edification and Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Righteouſneſs, and which 'twas dangerous to pervert to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>And if St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles, which were writ upon the Exigencies and with Regard to the State of Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Churches, were yet ſtill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to be of general Uſe; the ſame may be ſaid with much greater rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon concerning the <hi>Epiſtles</hi> of the reſt of the Apoſtles, with aim only at this General Deſign, to confirm thoſe in the Faith to whom they were directed, <hi>to exhort and teſtifie that this is the true Grace of God where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they ſtood</hi>
               <note n="d" place="margin">1 Pet 5.12.</note>, and to keep up the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance

of the Apoſtles Doctrine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their deceaſe</hi>
               <note n="e" place="margin">2 Pet. 1.15.</note>, as St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks concerning the Intent of his two Epiſtles.

            <p>Thus much I think ſufficient to prove that the Apoſtles themſelves deſign'd their Writings for the Perpetual Uſe of the Church, and look'd upon them as of Equal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority with the Inſpir'd Books of the Old Teſtament. I proceed to the</p>
            <p n="6">VI. and laſt Propoſition, <hi>viz. The Age immediately following that of the Apoſtles, look'd upon their Writings as the Standing Rule of Faith to the Chriſtian Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Certainly next to the Apoſtles themſelves, the Age immediately following was beſt able to know what the Apoſtles thought of their own Writings, and what Authority they challeng'd as due to them. <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> one of the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:93273:30"/>
Greateſt men of the Church in that Age, ſufficiently ſhews the Senſe of the Chriſtians of his own time concerning the Authority of theſe Writings. The <hi>Hereticks</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom he writes, pretended that their Opinions came origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally from the Apoſtles, and that, whatever the Apoſtles might ſay to the contrary in their Writings, yet they taught thoſe very things by word of mouth, which theſe Hereticks ſince maintain'd. In an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to this, <hi>Irenaeus</hi> does not only confute their Pretences, by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that there was Clear and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Tradition for the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Faith, which in thoſe early Times could eaſily be trac'd up to the very Apoſtles<note n="g" place="margin">
                  <hi>Iren.</hi> l. 3. c. 3.</note>: but likewiſe proves that 'tis in vain to ſet up <hi>Oral Tradition</hi> in Oppoſition to the Writings of the Apoſtles,<note n="h" place="margin">Ibid. l. 3. c. 1.</note> becauſe the <hi>very ſame Goſpel which they at firſt preach'd, they afterwards by the Will of God committed to Writing, to be the Foundation and Pillar of our Faith.</hi> In purſuance of which Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony we may further obſerve,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:93273:31"/>
that the very Arts which thoſe He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks uſed either to Undermine, or Evade the Authority of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical Writings, plainly ſhew their Authority was look'd upon as Sacred and Deciſive in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church.</p>
            <p>The Writers of the ſame Age do fully bear witneſs to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of the New Teſtament. The Learned Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> has obſerv'd<note n="i" place="margin">Diſſert. in <hi>Irenae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> l. n. 40, 41.</note> that St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Epiſtles</hi> were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally known and received in the Church ſooneſt of any of the New Teſtament Writings: and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, beſides the Teſtimony which St. <hi>Peter</hi> gives them, which we have already mention'd, we we may obſerve, that <hi>Ignatius</hi> the earlieſt Writer of the <hi>ſecond Age,</hi> is very induſtrious in imitating St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Style, and uſing his Expreſſions, as if he had a mind his Readers ſhould take notice that he had ſtudied his Epiſtles. The Authority indeed of the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to the Hebrews</hi> hath been call'd in queſtion, becauſe the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's not having ſet his Name to

But as this Epiſtle muſt be of Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Authority, being older than <hi>Clemens Romanus,</hi> who plainly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes to it in two places of his <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to the Corinthians</hi>

            <p>I thought it not improper to give this brief Account of the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies which are given by the earlieſt Chriſtian Writers, to the moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Books of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to ſhew how good a Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on there is for the Authority of the <hi>New-Teſtament Canon:</hi> and how little ground there is for Mr. <hi>Hobb's</hi> Inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation to the contrary, who tell us,<note n="q" place="margin">Levia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than <hi>part</hi> 3. c. 33.</note> 
               <hi>that the Writings of the Apoſtles were not received nor acknowledged as ſuch by the Church, till the Council of Laodicca, which was held in the Year</hi> 364. <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended them to Chriſtians.</hi> As if all Chriſtians did not agree in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:93273:32"/>
ſuch particular Books for the Writings of the Apoſtles, till they were <hi>Recommended to them,</hi> as he ſpeaks, and Enumerated by a Council. Which has as little truth in it, as what he ſays juſt after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, that at the time of this Council, <hi>all the Copies of the New Teſtament were in the hands of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticks,</hi> which if it be not a down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right and wilful falſity in him, is ſuch a piece of ignorance, as a groſſer cannot be found in all <hi>the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Darkneſs</hi> which he has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed. I find Men generally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in believing Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> to be the Author of the <hi>Leviathan</hi> and ſeveral other ill Books, and I fear too many have a great deference for their Authority, tho the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> (which according to him hath a juſter right to declare what Books or Doctrines are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, than a <hi>Council</hi>) hath not yet given us a Catalogue of his Writings or <hi>Recommended</hi> them to the World: neither of which could be true, if this Argument of his be good. But to return; I don't pretend to have
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:93273:33"/>
Collected all that can be alledged to prove the Antiquity of the New-Teſtament-Canon, nor will I go farther upon a Subject that is already undertaken by that <hi>Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Perſon</hi> who will ſhortly Publiſh an Elaborate <hi>Collection</hi> of all the <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Readings</hi> of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, from whom the World may expect full ſatisfaction as to this matter.</p>
            <p>However I can't but juſt take notice, that 'tis no prejudice to the Divine Authority of the N. Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as our Author intimates<note n="a" place="margin">Fr. <hi>p.</hi> 266.

He inſtances in the <hi>Epiſtle to the Hebrews.</hi> But there is ſufficient proof that S. <hi>Paul</hi> was the Author of that Epiſtle, as I have ſhewed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready. And as to the whole New-Teſtament Canon, 'twas certainly the deſign of thoſe that Compiled it, only to gather together the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the Apoſtles, or of ſuch as writ by their direction, as the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:93273:33"/>

So that the only reaſon why ſome Books were doubted of, was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it did not clearly appear whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were Writ by Apoſtles or not, and aſſoon as that point was cleared, their Authority was immediately Eſtabliſht. And ſo much for the proving the <hi>Sixth Propoſition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I think ſuppoſing theſe Six Propoſitions proved, this Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion will plainly follow from what has been ſaid, that the Books of the New-Teſtament were Written by God's <hi>Direction, and deſign'd by Him for the Perpetual uſe and Inſtruction of the Church,</hi> and are the only Fixt Rule which he has appointed for this purpoſe.</p>
            <p>I ſhall draw ſome <hi>Concluſions</hi> from theſe Premiſes, which will tend to illuſtrate and explain the Divine Inſpiration of the Holy Writings.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>It follows from hence that the Holy Ghoſt aſſiſted the Apoſtles as fully when they Writ, as when they Preached.</hi> How far this aſſiſtance extended,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:93273:34"/>
and wherein it conſiſted, I ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine particularly in the next Chapter: at preſent I intend only to ſhew that we may preſume there is as great a degree of Inſpiration to be found in their Writings, as was in their Preaching. For ſince the reaſon why this Aſſiſtance ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied them in their Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was the benefit of the Church, that they might <hi>Guide it into all Truth,</hi> without any danger of mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing error with it: the ſame reaſon holds much ſtronger for their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, which do not ſerve for the Inſtruction of One Age only, as their Preaching did, but of Many. And therefore tho we ſhould ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that they uſe Arguments <hi>ad Hominem</hi> ſometimes, and proceed upon ſuch <hi>Principles</hi> as were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally admitted in the Age they lived, without nicely examining whether they were true or not; yet this only ſhews that they thought fit to explain Divine Truths in ſuch a manner as was moſt ſuitable to the <hi>Capacity</hi> of the perſons they were immediately to Inſtruct. And
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:93273:34"/>
as we muſt grant that tho the New Teſtament was deſign'd for the uſe of future Ages, yet the Phraſe and Style and Argumentation uſed in it is wholly accommodated to the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents and Uſage of that Age in which 'twas writ: ſo S. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf does plainly imply that he does not always uſe the <hi>Beſt</hi> Arguments, but ſometimes ſuch as are beſt fitted to the Capacities and Notions of thoſe he Writes to. For thus we find him expreſs himſelf by way of excuſe for the Argument he makes uſe of,<note n="d" place="margin">Rom. 6.19.</note> 
               <hi>I ſpeak after the manner of men, becauſe of the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of your fleſh:</hi> which is as much as if he had ſaid, I could bring a better argument to prove what I ſay, but this which I make uſe of is more ſuitable to your Capacities, and may perhaps more effectually convince you, than a better.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It follows ſecondly, that <hi>ſince the Books of the New Teſtament,</hi> (and the ſame reaſon holds as to any other Writings of the ſame rank and uſe) <hi>were deſign'd to be a ſtanding rule of Faith to Chriſtians, the Holy Ghoſt,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:93273:35"/>
tho he did not generally Dictate the words which the holy Writers uſed, yet directed them to expreſs their minds in ſuch a manner, that thoſe who have a regard to the Dialect and way of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in which they write, might rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them; or at leaſt the Holy Spirit prevented their giving juſt occaſion for Men's errors and miſtakes in matters of Conſequence, by their Phraſes and Expreſſions.</hi> And ſuch a degree of aſſiſtance is abſolutely neceſſary to make theſe Books a <hi>ſtanding Rule of Faith.</hi> For tho we ſuppoſe the Holy Writers uſed a <hi>Popular</hi> ſtyle, and conſequently made uſe of ſuch <hi>Hyperboles</hi> and <hi>Metaphors</hi> and other Improprieties of Speech, which common practiſe allows of in all Languages, (eſpecially where they occaſionally ſpeak of <hi>Philoſophical</hi> matters, and things not immediately relating to Religion:) yet unleſs we ſuppoſe them to ſpeak properly in thoſe <hi>Terms</hi> of <hi>Art</hi> which are of fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental uſe in the explaining the Doctrines of Chriſtianity, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſenſe of which whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies turn, and as they are
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:93273:35"/>
differently taken they alter the very face of the Chriſtian Religion; I ſay, except we ſuppoſe the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles to ſpeak properly, <hi>i. e.</hi> agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to their own Simplicity and Plainneſs of Speech, and in ſuch a manner as was moſt likely to be underſtood by thoſe they writ to, when they treat of matters of great Importance, and ſuch as are juſtly to be reckon'd <hi>Fundamental</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, the New Teſtament will not anſwer the ends of a Rule of Faith. For a Book is of no uſe to explain or decide any Controverſy, if we can have no ſixt rule where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to judge of its ſtyle, ſo as to be in ſome meaſure certain what is its true ſenſe. And 'tis very ſtrange if a Book writ by perſons who had an extraordinary aſſiſtance from God, and which was deſign'd for Univerſal uſe, ſhould not be worded with that care which Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Induſtry uſes in matters of Importance. And therefore we have reaſon to rely upon the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Holy Spirit, even with relation to the <hi>Phraſe</hi> and <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:93273:36"/>
of the Scripture, and to believe that he has ſo far directed the holy Pen-men, that their Phraſes and Expreſſions ſhould not lead Men into error in <hi>matters of Conſequence;</hi> but may be rightly underſtood by thoſe that acquaint themſelves with the Dialect in which they writ, and conſult the Ages neareſt the Apoſtles, who muſt needs be, next to their own ſtyle, the beſt Judges of their ſenſe. If indeed the <hi>Socinian</hi> Doctrines concerning the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction of Chriſt</hi> were true, it muſt be confeſſed there would be little reaſon to believe that the Holy Ghoſt had a hand in word<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scriptures: nay then the Scriptures will appear to be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in ſuch a ſtyle, as if the Writers deſign'd to lead Men into error. And the <hi>Socinians</hi> themſelves, when they make <hi>Reaſon</hi> the <hi>ſole Judge</hi> of Sripture, and tell us they will not believe any thing contrary to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, tho it were never ſo plainly aſſerted in Scripture, do in effect confeſs that the expreſſions of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, taken in their natural and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:93273:36"/>
moſt obvious ſenſe, do not at all favour their Opinions<note n="e" place="margin">

And therefore 'tis no wonder to find theſe Gentlemen warn their Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſo often not to make Inferences from the <hi>Phraſes</hi> of Scripture, as if they were uſed ſtrictly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly: that they ſo often tell us of the Improprieties and Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phors which the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Writers, and thoſe who imitate them, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound with: that the Apoſtles <hi>play with Words</hi> as <hi>Socinus</hi> with Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence ſpeaks<note n="f" place="margin">Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrationis verbo eſſe argutus <hi>Socm.</hi> de Chr Ser<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

by notions of <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> which the Holy Writers never heard of, or elſe they have not inquir'd into the Sentiments of thoſe times in which theſe Books were writ, but have judged of their ſenſe by the <hi>Schemes,</hi> and applied them to the <hi>Diſputes</hi> of <hi>Modern</hi> Ages, as if they were writ only with a regard to the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies that ſhould ariſe in <hi>After-Times,</hi> without any reſpect to the Sentiments and Exigencies of the Age wherein they were written. But if we have a regard only to the Genius of the Language which the Holy Writers uſed, and judge of their Sentiments by the State of the Church in their time, and by ſuch Ancient Authors as were moſt likely to be acquainted with the Notions which were then generally received; I don't think laying ſtreſs upon the Phraſes of the Scriptures can lead us into ſuch groſs errors as Mr. <hi>N.</hi> imagines<note n="k" place="margin">Eng. <hi>p.</hi> 146. Fr <hi>p.</hi> 234.</note>. And without ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing this, we can ſcarce deduce any Inferences from Scripture Texts, and yet this is practis'd by the Apoſtles themſelves, who ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:93273:37"/>
argue from Words, and thoſe too taken in their niceſt ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. A remarkable example of which is that Inference of S. <hi>Paul's,</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Since God in his Providence took care that theſe Books ſhould be Writ for the uſe of his Church, and therefore gave Providential occaſions for their being Written, it follows that they are Compos'd in ſuch a manner as not to exclude the uſe of the Natural Reaſon and Meditation of the Writers who Compos'd them.</hi>

            <p>Works of Providence are not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to exclude Humane means, and we believe many things to be brought to paſs by the determinate Counſel and Power of God, tho they are not purely Miraculous and and meerly God's own Act and Deed, but are brought to paſs by ſecond Cauſes as his Inſtruments. And why then can't he give Men a Rule of Faith and Manners, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Writing be with the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:93273:38"/>
Finger of God,</hi> as the <hi>Two Tables</hi> were? 'Tis certain that the ordinary Operations of the Spirit do only excite and aſſiſt our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Faculties, not ſuperſede or render them uſeleſs. And even the extraordinary ones do very often influence Men's minds after the ſame manner, as appears by S. <hi>Paul's</hi> advice to <hi>Timothy,</hi>
               <note n="m" place="margin">1 Tim. 4.14.</note> 
               <hi>Give atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance to Reading, to Exhortation, to Doctrine, neglect not the gift which is in thee, which was given thee by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy.</hi> And to the ſame purpoſe he ſpeaks in the ſecond Epiſtle<note n="n" place="margin">2 Tim. 1.6.</note>. And therefore tho we ſuppoſe the Authors of the Scriptures to have been Inſpir'd, and to have had the extraordinary Aſſiſtances of God's Spirit, yet this will not exclude the uſe of their Natural Talents, but that the Writers made uſe of them as far as they could be ſerviceable to their purpoſe, and God ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied their defects. From hence appears the weakneſs of that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument which is urged by our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and by ſome others, againſt the Inſpiration of the <hi>Poetical</hi>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:93273:38"/>

               </note> becauſe the <hi>things contain'd in them are either of the Writers own Knowledge, or elſe taken from Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Memoirs, or the Relation of others.</hi> To the ſame purpoſe 'tis urged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Divine Authority of S. <hi>Paul's</hi> Epiſtles by <hi>Spinoza,</hi>
               <note n="q" place="margin">
                  <hi>Theol. Polit.</hi> c. 11</note> that <hi>they are full of Argumentation,</hi> which he thinks muſt be the effect of S. <hi>Paul's</hi> own reaſon. As if a Man that had a perfect Syſteme of the Chriſtian Religion infuſed into his mind by Revelation, as we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe S. <hi>Paul</hi> to have had, did not apprehend it after a Rational man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and ſee the whole <hi>Series</hi> and Chain of its Principles, by the help of which he could infer one thing from another. But is it not a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Argument againſt the Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Book, that it is writ in a Rational and Argumentative way? which muſt either ſuppoſe that 'tis below God Almighty to give a reaſon for his Inſtitutions: or elſe
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:93273:39"/>
that 'twas not proper for the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, to ſhew their <hi>Diſciples</hi> that the Doctrines they taught them were ſuch as might be Rationally deduc'd from certain Principles, and to confute their <hi>Adverſaries</hi> the ſame way, who would not ſubmit to their bare Authority, nor believe a thing to be true, meerly becauſe they ſaid ſo.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>It follows from what has bin ſaid, that 'tis no Argument againſt a Book's being deſign'd by God for the perpetual uſe of the Church, that 'twas at firſt writ upon ſome particular Exigency, and with relation to the peculiar Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the perſons to whom 'tis directed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For ſome of thoſe Books of the Old Teſtament which were certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſign'd for the publick benefit of the Church, as 'tis granted by all that acknowledge any ſuch thing as Inſpiration, (and I don't at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent concern my ſelf with any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) I ſay ſome of the Undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly Inſpir'd Writings were occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd by the particular Exigences of thoſe times in which their Authors
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:93273:39"/>
lived. I mean the Books of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> who were all ſent by God to teſtify againſt the ſins which were committed in their own times. And if God ſo order'd it, that theſe Prophecies ſhould be of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual uſe to the Church, why may not the other <hi>Occaſional</hi> Writings of the Scripture, if I may ſo term them, have been compos'd with the ſame Deſign? I have already shewed<note n="r" place="margin">P. 19.</note> that the manner of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Writing does excellently anſwer this Intent. From hence it appears that the Argument uſed by ſome <hi>Popiſh</hi> Writers why the New Teſtament cannot be a perfect Rule of the Chriſtian Faith, becauſe ſeveral parts of it were writ only with Relation to particular Exigencies of ſome one Church, holds as well againſt the Old Teſtament being a Rule to the Jews, becauſe a great part of of it, <hi>viz.</hi> the Prophecies, were oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd by the particular Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of thoſe Times in which the Prophets lived.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> A more particular Inquiry into the nature of the Apoſtolical Gifts and Inſpiration.</head>
            <p>HAving ſaid thus much in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral concerning the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Authority and Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Apoſtolical Writings, I proceed to examine more diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Aſſertions which the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Letters</hi> hath laid down concerning the Inſpiration of the Apoſtles and of their Writings: and in order to that ſhall conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der particularly, both as to their Nature and Extent, ſome of the moſt remarkable <hi>Gifts,</hi> with which the Holy Spirit indowed the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles. I find our Author is very induſtrious to leſſen the Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Gifts, as much as he can, and to repreſent them very little above their natural Faculties. He indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to ſhew, <q>That the Operation of the Holy Spirit upon their Minds,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:93273:40"/>
conſiſted chiefly in refreſhing their Memories,<note n="a" place="margin">Fr. p. 254, 257. En. p. 66. 70.</note> and bringing to their Remembrance what Chriſt had ſaid unto them. He does indeed ſay,<note n="b" place="margin">Fr. 255. En. p. 67.</note> That ſometimes the Holy Spirit made them underſtand by extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Revelations, that which Chriſt had ſaid unto them whilſt he was with them, but which they then underſtood not. <hi>And that</hi> they had many imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Revelations and divers heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Viſions<note n="c" place="margin">Fr. p. 252. Eng. 62.</note>. <hi>And in another place,</hi>
                  <note n="d" place="margin">Fr. 257. Eng. p. 70.</note> That perhaps the Spirit open'd their Minds after a manner we compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend not.</q> But while he ſets out the Objections againſt the Inſpiration of the Apoſtles in the beſt Light, and with the greateſt Force he can, he paſſes over the Evidences for it very ſlightly, and looks upon their Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Inſpirations to have been ſo extraordinary, and to have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd ſo ſeldom, that he does not ſtick roundly to declare,<note n="e" place="margin">Ubi ſup.</note> 
               <hi>That their Infallibility conſiſted in relating faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully what they had ſeen and heard.</hi> He likewiſe endeavours to ſhew,<note n="f" place="margin">Fr. p. 240. &amp;c. Eng. p. 42, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>That they had not an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Aſſiſtance, when they were ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:93273:41"/>
before the Secular Powers, upon the account of their Religion.</hi> And he makes this another argument againſt the Inſpiration of the Apoſtles, and other perſons in thoſe times whom the Scripture ſpeaks of as inſpir'd,<note n="g" place="margin">Fr. p. 248, 249. 259. Eng. p. 57. 74.</note> that <hi>they confer'd with one another, and ſubmitted to one another's Judgments, and did not come to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion concerning any matter in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no, till after long Deliberation, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation with each other:</hi> with many other Cavils of leſs weight.

                  <item>III. <hi>I ſhall ſhew that the Aſſiſtance of the Holy Spirit did not conſiſt only or chiefly in Improving their Natural Faculties, or Strengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Refreſhing their Memories.</hi>

            <p n="1">I. As to the firſt of theſe Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, <hi>What were the Caſes wherein the Apoſtles did not act or ſpeak by Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> I conceive we may allow them to be theſe following.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Where they treat of the common Occurrences of Life, and ſuch things as have no Relation at all to Divine Truths.</hi> As when St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of his deſign to take <hi>Rome</hi>
               <note n="h" place="margin">Rom. 15.24.</note> in his way to <hi>Spain,</hi> and to call at<note n="i" place="margin">2 Cor. 1.16.</note>

                  <hi>v.</hi> 1 Cor. 1.16. r. Joh. 6.19. Act. 19</note>. Hitherto we may refer <hi>Slips of memory in matters of

no conſequence,</hi> ſome Examples of which there are to be found in in the N. Teſtament<note n="n" place="margin">
                  <hi>v.</hi> Mat. 27.9. Act. 7.16.</note>.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Such things as were matters only of Humane Prudence, being of an Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent nature in themſelves, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently not the proper Subjects of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation.</hi> For matters of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, <hi>i. e.</hi> Where God has given men no fix'd rule, but left them at liberty to determine for themſelves accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as their circumſtances ſhall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, as they are not the proper Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of a Divine Law, ſo neither are they of a Divine Revelation. Such is the Caſe of <hi>married perſons where one party is an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbeliever,</hi> which St. <hi>Paul</hi> conſiders,<note n="o" place="margin">1 Cor. 7.12.</note> and reſolves by the Rules of humane Prudence, (and therefore tells us before hand, that 'tis <hi>He</hi> that ſpeaks, <hi>not the Lord</hi>) ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his meaſures from the general Law of Chriſtian Charity. For as to this Caſe I look upon Mr. <hi>Thorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dike</hi>'s<note n="p" place="margin">Laws of the Church, p. 117.</note> Opinion as the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, which is, That the Apoſtle look'd upon Marriage made by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons before they were Chriſtians, to lay no ſtricter Obligation upon
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:93273:42"/>
the Parties, than the Laws which they were under when the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age was contracted, deſign'd to lay upon them. So that if two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who were under the Laws of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire married, and afterward one of them turn'd Chriſtian, this did not at all alter the Conditions of the Marriage, in reſpect of the Converted Party, from what they were before: nor in a Marriage contracted by Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, under the ſtate of <hi>Heatheniſm,</hi> is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Party by virtue of his imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Chriſtianity afterward, oblig'd anew by the ſtricter Ties of the Chriſtian Law concerning Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, but only by thoſe which the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws required, upon which Terms the Marriage was made at firſt: and ſo might upon juſt occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, take Advantage of the Privilege which the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws permitted, of being Divorc'd for other Cauſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that which was allowed by our Saviour. Now the reaſon why the Laws of Chriſtianity do not extend to a Marriage contracted under a ſtate of Heatheniſm I conceive to
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:93273:43"/>
be this, becauſe Heathen Marriages being not in their own nature In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſoluble, as Chriſtian Marriages are, but the Parties having reſerv'd to themſelves a liberty to part from each other, in ſuch Caſes as the Laws of each Country allowed, the nature of the Marriage-contract ſtill continues the ſame, after the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of either Party which it did before, <hi>i.e.</hi> Diſſoluble, unleſs the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Party can perſwade the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing, to oblige himſelf to the Obſervation of thoſe ſtricter Laws of Matrimony, which are injoin'd by Chriſt. Without which mutual Conſent the Marriage continues the ſame it was before, while both Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were Unbelievers: and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Laws of Chriſt do not reach this Caſe, being appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable only to thoſe Marriages which are made in the Chriſtian Church, or at leaſt which are made Chriſtian by an After-act, and mutual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Parties to ſubmit to the Chriſtian Law in this particular. This Opinion ſeems to be counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanc'd by the Apoſtle in the 15. verſe of that Chapter.<note n="q" place="margin">1 Cor. 7.15.</note> 
               <hi>If the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:93273:43"/>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbeliever depart, a Brother or Siſter is not under Bondage in ſuch Caſes:</hi> the moſt natural Senſe of which Words is, If the Marriage Contract be broke on the Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers ſide, the Believer is no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger tied<note n="q" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. <hi>V.</hi> ver. 39. &amp; Rom. 7.1, 2, 3.</note> by it. Which is not true of a Marriage where the Laws of Chriſtianity take place, for there the Breach of the Marriage Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant on one ſide, does not diſſolve the Bond, nor releaſe the other party from the Obligation of it, except in the Caſe of Adultery, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> does not here ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Which ſeems to me plainly to prove that St. <hi>Paul</hi> did not think the Laws of Chriſtianity were to be extended to ſuch Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages as theſe. This ſeems too to have been the ſenſe of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtians, by the Story which gave occaſion to <hi>Juſtin Martyrs firſt Apology,</hi> (as 'tis uſually reckon'd) concerning a Woman<note n="r" place="margin">
                  <hi>Apol.</hi> 1. init.</note> that being Converted to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, after having uſed many endeavours to reclaim her Husband from his vicious courſe of Life,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:93273:44"/>
when they all proved ineffectual, ſent him a Divorce drawn up ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the form preſcribed by the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws<note n="a" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Ibid.</note>. This action of hers is commended by <hi>Juſtin Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr;</hi> which I ſuppoſe he would not have done, if he had thought the Laws of the Goſpel took place in ſuch a Marriage as this, which was contracted in a ſtate of Heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm. For certainly Chriſtianity does not allow the Wife to put away her Husband upon any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count whatſoever: ſince that was never allowed by <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, nor ever practis'd among the <hi>Jews</hi> till <hi>Herod's</hi> time, when <hi>Salome</hi> ſent a Bill of Divorce to her Husband, which was done contrary to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Laws, as <hi>Joſephus</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">
                  <hi>Antiq.</hi> l. 15. c. 9. <hi>p.</hi> 532. B.</note>, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates it, obſerves. And if this be the true ſtate of the caſe concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Marriage, where one party is a Convert to Chriſtianity, and the true ground of S. <hi>Paul's</hi> reſolving the queſtion propoſed to him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this matter; the reaſon is plain why he introduces his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer with this Preface, <hi>I, not the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:93273:44"/>
Lord</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">1 Cor. 7.12.</note>; for this caſe is of the ſame nature with the other Indifferent things S. <hi>Paul</hi> diſcourſes of in the ſame Chapter, where he gives his judgement about the ſtate of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity and Widowhood. The doubts concerning which matters he reſolves by the Rules of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and with reſpect to the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Diſtreſs</hi>
               <note n="d" place="margin">1 Cor. 7.26.</note>, and the difficulties which attended the Profeſſion of Chriſtianity. The Apoſtle indeed ſays, <hi>I give my Opinion</hi> about theſe queſtions, <hi>as one that hath obtain'd mercy of the Lord to be faithful</hi>
               <note n="e" place="margin">1 Cor. 7.25.</note>, and again, <hi>After my judgement, and I think that I alſo have the Spirit of God</hi>
               <note n="f" place="margin">ver. 40.</note>. But this is not ſpoke with the Authority of an Apoſtle or Teacher ſent by God, but in ſuch a ſtyle as implies only an ordinary Aſſiſtance, ſuch as any Pious skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Paſtor may ſtill expect: for 'tis as if he had ſaid, <q>I do ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give you the beſt Advice I can, my judgement is not byaſs'd by any corrupt end, I have no other deſign but to promote God's Glory and your good, and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:93273:45"/>
therefore I may be pretty confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that the Spirit of God whoſe influences I have often felt, hath now ſo far Aſſiſted me, that I have adviſed you for the beſt.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Another Inſtance wherein we may reaſonably ſuppoſe the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles ſpoke without Inſpiration, is <hi>when they diſcourſe of ſuch things as our Saviour told them they muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be ignorant of.</hi> Such as was the time when the <hi>Day of Judgment ſhould come,</hi> which was a ſecret God had reſerved<note n="g" place="margin">Matt. 24.36.</note> to himſelf: and of <hi>Reſtoring the Kingdom to Iſrael</hi>
               <note n="h" place="margin">Act. 1.6.</note>. As to the former of theſe, 'tis plain the Apoſtles thought the Day of Judgement would come in their own time, or within a very little while afterward<note n="i" place="margin">See 1 Theſ. 4.14. 2 Theſ. 2.2. 1 Cor. 10, 11. —15.52. 2 Cor. 5.3. 2 Pet. 3.4. 1 Pet. 4.7. Heb. 9.26.</note>. But this they only gathered by Humane Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and conjectures drawn from ſome Expreſſions found in the Old Teſtament, or uſed by our Saviour, ſuch as the Calling the times of the Goſpel <hi>the Latter Days,</hi> an Expreſſion often uſed by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and our Saviour's joining
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:93273:45"/>
together the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> and the End of the World in S. <hi>Matthew</hi> the 24th. And as the event has proved that they were miſtaken, ſo they themſelves did not pretend to Revelation for what they ſaid in this caſe, but ſpoke of it in doubtful terms, as may be ſeen in the place above cited<note n="k" place="margin">2 Cor. 5.3. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note>, <hi>If ſo be we ſhall be found Cloth'd, not naked,</hi> for ſo the Words ſhould be Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated.</p>
            <p>In theſe caſes I think 'twill be no prejudice to the Divine Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Apoſtles, to allow them to have ſpoke like Men. And 'tis unreaſonable for any to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that if we grant thus much, we do in effect give up the Cauſe, and that then 'twill be impoſſible to diſtinguiſh what the Apoſtles ſay by the Spirit, and what they ſpeak of themſelves. For ſure Men may diſtinguiſh if they pleaſe, the Myſteries of Faith, and the Rules of Practice, from a <hi>Cloke</hi> and <hi>Parchments,</hi> or a <hi>Journey to Corinth:</hi> which belong to the firſt excepted Caſe. And in the ſecond, we have

the Apoſtle himſelf plainly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing this from his uſual way of Writing, and telling us that 'tis <hi>he ſpeaks, not the Lord</hi>
               <note n="l" place="margin">1 Cor. 7.12. <hi>V.</hi> 2 Cor. 11.17.</note>, and that <hi>he had no Commandment from the Lord, but only gave his Judgement</hi>
               <note n="m" place="margin">1 Cor. 7.25.</note>. The ſame Expreſſion we find elſewhere in a like caſe<note n="n" place="margin">2 Cor. 8.8, 10.</note>, <hi>viz.</hi> concerning the meaſures of Charity, which are to be ſettled by the Rules of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and don't fall under a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Command. Now if <hi>an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception confirms a Rule in Caſes not Excepted,</hi> we may juſtly infer from the Apoſtles ſetting a mark upon theſe Diſcourſes to diſtinguiſh them from Divine Commands, that where there is no ſuch diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mark, we muſt ſuppoſe him to deliver what he ſays under the Character of an Apoſtle and a Meſſenger of God, unleſs the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Diſcourſe do plainly imply the contrary, and be ſuch as properly belongs to the two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Heads of excepted Caſes. As to the third Inſtance of Excepted Caſes, the Evangeliſts have ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently forewarn'd us not to look
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:93273:46"/>
upon any Mans Judgement as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible in this matter, ſince they have Recorded<note n="o" place="margin">Matt. 24.36. Mark 13.32.</note> thoſe words of our Saviour, where he tells his Diſciples, that the <hi>Day and Hour of the General Judgement was a ſecret God has reſerved to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> and has not thought fit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal it to any Creature of what Rank or Degree ſoever; <hi>no not to the Son himſelf:</hi> and tho he were the great Prophet of the Church, yet 'twas no part of his Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to reveal the Counſel of God in this matter: and therefore to be ſure his Diſciples would never pretend to know more then their Maſter.</p>
            <p>Having thus conſidered the Caſes in which the Apoſtles ſpake or writ without Inſpiration, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in the</p>
            <p n="2">II. Place to ſhew, that <hi>Excepting thoſe Caſes, the Apoſtles writ and ſpake by the particular Aſſiſtance and Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Author confines the Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility of their Preaching and Writing to thoſe things which they
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:93273:47"/>
               <hi>Learn'd from Chriſt, or related as ſpoken by him</hi>
               <note n="p" place="margin">Fr. <hi>p.</hi> 256, 257. Eng. <hi>p.</hi> 69, 70.</note>. But as to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments which they fram'd upon thoſe Principles, and the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences they deduc'd from the Old Teſtament, here he ſuppoſes them to have uſed only their own Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory and Judgment, tho he grants theſe Diſcourſes of theirs are to be received, becauſe <hi>there's nothing in them but what is conformable to the Doctrine of Chriſt and to right Reaſon, and nothing that can lead us into the Belief of what is falſe or contrary to Piety</hi>
               <note n="q" place="margin">En. <hi>p.</hi> 112, 131, 135. Fr. <hi>p.</hi> 282, 283. 224, 227.</note>. This, as exactly as I can gather, is all the Authority he allows the Sermons and Writings of the Apoſtles: and this indeed is as much Authority as can be given to any Humane Diſcourſe, and tho it does not exclude all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, yet it excludes all likelyhood of error. But as we look upon the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles to have been ſomewhat more than <hi>Sound Divines,</hi> or Men that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well underſtood the Doctrine which they were to teach others: ſo their Diſcourſes and Writings have been always eſteem'd of an
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:93273:47"/>
higher Rank than any Religious Treatiſes purely Humane, which however ſolid and true they may be, are to be judged of by theſe Writings, and are no further true than they agree with them. The Scripture makes this the Characte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtick of an Apoſtle, whereby he was diſtinguiſht from the other Inſpir'd perſons who were then in the Church, viz. <hi>that he did not learn the Goſpel in an Humane way</hi>

Apoſtles by Divine Revelation, only that they might teach it to others, whether by Word or Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, with the greater aſſurance and certainty, and without any danger of error, their Diſcourſes which were deſign'd for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Church, muſt be the effects of this ſupernatural ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of Chriſtian Knowledge, which God infus'd into their minds. I have ſhewed in the former Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<note n="u" place="margin">P. 29.</note>, <hi>that the ſame Aſſiſtance accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied the Apoſtles in their Writing which did in their Preaching,</hi> and therefore ſhall now ſpeak of theſe two indifferently, and ſhew what kind of Authority the Apoſtles claim'd in either of them.

               <note n="x" place="margin">John 16.12.</note>. Such was particularly the <hi>Doctrine of the Croſs,</hi> which S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Diſcourſe chiefly relates to in that place<note n="y" place="margin">1 Cor. 1.18, <hi>&amp;c</hi> &amp;c. 2.2</note>. Theſe things S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays

               <hi>We have the mind of the Chriſt,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:93273:49"/>
ye are to hearken to us, and receive what we ſay, tho in many things not agreeing with the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Philoſophy, or Worldly Wiſdom, which the Apoſtle in the Verſes before<note n="f" place="margin">1 Cor. 1.20, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> c. 2.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> had undervalued, in compariſon of the Goſpel. In all which Diſcourſe S. <hi>Paul</hi> plainly aſcribes his and the reſt of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles Preaching to the Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the Holy Ghoſt gave them, without making any reſtrictions, and particularly that part of it which conſiſted in drawing Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, and bringing Proofs from the Old Teſtament.</p>
            <p>Again we find the ſame Apoſtle threatning thoſe that deſpiſe his Advice, as <hi>not deſpiſing man but God, who gave the Apoſtles his holy Spirit</hi>
               <note n="g" place="margin">1 Theſ. 4.8.</note>, that they might teach with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controulable Authority. And I think we may fairly conclude from hence, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> expected all his Precepts and Inſtructions ſhould be ſubmitted to, not meerly as coming from one of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the Church, but as having ſomething more then Humane Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:93273:49"/>
and being derived from the Spirit of God. For what he ſays in this place, tho it immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately reſpect only thoſe Advices which are contain'd in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going part of the Chapter, may by parity of Reaſon be applied to all other Apoſtolical injunctions: for as the words are general, and do not ſpecify that the Apoſtle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd theſe particular Rules by an extraordinary Revelation, more than any others which he elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where gives, ſo neither are the Advices ſuch in their own Nature, as require a greater degree of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration to deliver them, than the other Exhortations and Commands which are every where to be found in the Apoſtolical Writings. From whence I conclude, we ought to look upon thoſe Writings as a Divine Rule of Faith and Practiſe, and that he who deſpiſes or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalues them, <hi>deſpiſes not man, but God, who gave his holy Spirit</hi> to the Authors of them. And how far our Author may be guilty of this fault, I leave it to God and his
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:93273:50"/>
own Conſcience to Judge. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to ſhew</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>That the Aſſiſtance which the Holy Spirit gave to the Apoſtles did not conſiſt only in refreſhing their Memories, or Improving their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Faculties, but was in ſeveral reſpects a new degree of ſupernatural Knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Author is willing to believe, as appears by the places<note n="h" place="margin">Fr. <hi>p.</hi> 254.-257. Eng. <hi>p.</hi> 66.—70.</note> I have before cited, that the Aſſiſtance the Holy Ghoſt gave to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, <hi>did chiefly, and in a manner only conſiſt in refreſhing their memory, and recalling to their mind what our Saviour had taught them.</hi> And agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to this opinion he tells us<note n="i" place="margin">Fr. <hi>p.</hi> 255. En. <hi>p.</hi> 67.</note>, <hi>that when our Saviour promiſes his Diſciples</hi>
               <note n="k" place="margin">John 15.26.</note>, That the Holy Ghoſt ſhall teach them all things, and bring all things to their remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, <hi>theſe latter words apparently explain the foregoing,</hi> as if the Holy Ghoſt's teaching them was nothing elſe but bringing to their remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance what Chriſt had taught them before. Now I deny not but that our Saviour declar'd to
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:93273:50"/>
his Diſciples <hi>the whole Counſel of God,</hi> and therefore when he gave them Commiſſion to <hi>go and teach all Nations,</hi> he makes this the Rule they were to go by in Preaching, <hi>viz. to teach whatever he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them</hi>
               <note n="l" place="margin">Matt. 28.20.</note>, as containing the whole Doctrine of Chriſtianity: but granting all this, yet 'twill ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear from ſeveral inſtances, that the Aſſiſtance of the Spirit was ſomething more than bringing to their remembrance what Chriſt had ſaid unto them. For</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Some things our Saviour did not only not explain to them fully, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe made uſe of ſuch Expreſſions when he ſpoke of them, as were accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Notions the Apoſtles were prepoſſeſs'd with.</hi> Thus when He diſcourſed to them of the Nature of his Kingdom, he made uſe of ſuch Expreſſions as in their moſt natural and obvious Senſe did im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, that 'twas to be a Temporal One: for he deſcribed the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which his Diſciples were to enjoy in it, by <hi>eating and drinking at his Table, and ſitting upon twelve
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:93273:51"/>
Thrones judging the twelve Tribes of Iſrael</hi>
               <note n="m" place="margin">Luke 22.30. Matt. 19.28.</note>. Which Expreſſions did tend directly to confirm them in their prejudices concerning the Worldly Grandeur of Chriſt's king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: our Saviour not thinking it a proper ſeaſon as yet to wean them from theſe Opinions, which had taken ſuch deep root in their minds, that they could not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpated all of a ſudden, but muſt be removed by gentle and eaſy degrees. Now to give the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles a right underſtanding as to this matter, 'twas not ſufficient the holy Spirit ſhould recall to their memory the words which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour had uſed upon this ſubject, for thoſe alone would rather confirm them in the falſe Notions they had entertain'd concerning theſe things, than inſtruct them in the true one: but 'twas further requiſite, that the Spirit ſhould give them a clear and diſtinct apprehenſion of the Spiritual Nature of Chriſt's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and wherein the Glory and Happineſs it promiſes, conſiſts: and ſhould further inform them
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:93273:51"/>
for what Reaſons our Saviour choſe, in compliance with their apprehenſions, and in conformity to the Style of the Old Teſtament, to wrap up theſe things in Obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and diſcourſe of them under the vail of Types and Figures. And I think this was to inlighten their minds with a new degree of Supernatural Knowledge.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But beſides thoſe things which our Saviour concealed under Types and Figures, <hi>There were others he obſcurely Expreſs'd in Parables.</hi> As the Calling of the Gentiles in the Parable<note n="a" place="margin">Matt. 20.5, 6.</note> of the <hi>Houſholder that went out at the latter end of the Day to hire Labourers into his Vineyard.</hi> The rejection of the Jews under the Parable<note n="b" place="margin">Matt. 22.1.</note> of <hi>the perſons invited to a Marriage Feaſt, who would not come.</hi> Several other inſtances of the ſame kind might be given. Now to underſtand theſe things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, ſomething more was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite than juſt to remember our Saviour's words: as is plain by the Diſciples asking our Saviour the meaning of another Parable of his,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:93273:52"/>
viz. <hi>That of the tares of the Field</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">Matt. 13.36. <hi>v.</hi> c. 15.15.</note>. The words they remembred per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly well, but were at a loſs for the meaning and deſign of them, and therefore deſir'd him to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain it to them. And by the ſame Reaſon there was need of a greater degree of Illumination, to certify them that the Gentiles were to be <hi>Fellow-heirs, and partakers of the Promiſes of Chriſt,</hi> than the bare putting them in mind of thoſe ſhort hints our Saviour had given them concerning this matter, would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to. And accordingly we find that St. <hi>Peter</hi> had need of a Viſion<note n="d" place="margin">Act. 10.</note> to inſtruct him in this matter: and even that extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Revelation ſeem'd ſcarce ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to convince him of this truth. For afterward, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Viſion he had formerly ſeen, he relapſed again into his old notions, and ſeparated himſelf from the Gentile-Converts at <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch</hi>
               <note n="e" place="margin">Gal. 2.11.</note>. Which is a pregnant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance how much need the Apoſtles had of an extraordinary degree of Clearneſs and Evidence, fully to
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:93273:52"/>
inſtruct and convince them in thoſe points of Chriſtianity that were oppoſite to the Opinions they had formerly imbraced: and that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more was requiſite to that purpoſe, than juſt to remember what our Saviour had ſaid upon this Subject. For even that Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion it ſelf did not fully explain to St. <hi>Peter</hi> God's Counſel and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and 'tis likely he thought there was no more implied by it, than that he ſhould receive thoſe Gentiles, who voluntarily offer'd themſelves. The firſt that were ſent to <hi>Preach</hi> the Goſpel to the Gentiles were S. <hi>Paul</hi> and S. <hi>Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas,</hi> when the <hi>Holy Ghoſt ſeparated them</hi> for this purpoſe<note n="f" place="margin">Acts 13.2. comp. with ver. 46.</note>. And 'tis upon this Account that St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls himſelf<note n="g" place="margin">Rom. 11.13. Gal. 2.9 Eph. 3.1. 1 Tim. 2.7.</note> the <hi>Apoſtle of the Gentiles:</hi> and ſays in expreſs terms that the Salvation of the Gentiles, by their being Incorporated into the Church, and making one Body with the Jews, was a Doctrine which was but then newly<note n="h" place="margin">Eph. 3.5, 6.</note> RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VEALED <hi>to the Apoſtles and Prophets by the</hi> SPIRIT. And we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:93273:53"/>
that the ſame S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times expreſſes the Knowledge of the Goſpel, with which the holy Spirit furniſht the Apoſtles, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpir'd perſons of thoſe times, by the word<note n="i" place="margin">1 Cor. 14.6, 26, 30. —2.10.

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to imply that in ſeveral reſpects, it was not ſo much a Revival of what our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour taught them while he was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth, as a piece of Knowledge intirely new, and a diſtinct Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We may inſtance in another ſort of true and proper Inſpiration which belong'd to the Apoſtles, and that is, <hi>The gift of Prophecy it ſelf, and of applying the Prophecies of the Old Teſtament to the times of the Goſpel, and ſhewing that they are truly fulfilled in Chriſt and his Church.</hi>
            </p>

a peculiar gift beſtowed upon the Apoſtles by the holy Spirit. 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they themſelves look upon it as ſuch, as appears by St. <hi>Paul's</hi> reckoning <gap reason="foreign">

As to the Prophecies, 'tis not likely that any perſons without a Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Illumination, could look to the end and utmoſt Completion of them, ſince the Prophets them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves had not this priviledge grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, as appears from thoſe places<note n="ſ" place="margin">Rom. 16.25. 1 Cor. 2.7. Eph. 3.9. Coloſ. 1.26.</note> where the Goſpel is called a <hi>Myſtery kept ſecret ſince the World
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:93273:54"/>
began:</hi> a <hi>hidden Myſtery,</hi> and <hi>hid from Ages and Generations:</hi> And eſpecially from thoſe remarkable words of St. <hi>Peter</hi>
               <note n="t" place="margin">1 Pet. 1.10, 11, 12.</note>, <hi>Of which Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> [by Chriſt] <hi>the Prophets have inquir'd and ſearched diligently, who prophecied of the Grace that ſhould come unto you, ſearching what and what manner of time the Spirit of Chriſt which was in them did ſignify, when it teſtified beforehand the Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Chriſt, and the Glory that ſhould follow: To whom it was revealed that not to themſelves, but to us they did Miniſter theſe things.</hi> From whence it appears, that tho the Prophets were very Inquiſitive after the Manner how, and the Time when their Prophecies ſhould be fulfill'd, yet they had only this general Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, that they ſhould not be fulfill'd in their own time. And I think we may infer from thence, that the perfect underſtanding them was reſerv'd to the times of the Meſſias. And tho the event would ſufficiently Interpret the meaning of ſeveral of them, yet there were ſome that needed a
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:93273:55"/>
greater Light than that to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them, and apply them aright. To which we may add, that the manner of Interpreting the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies of the Old Teſtament which the Apoſtles uſed, is a Rule to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Ages how they are to Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret the Prophetical Writings, and prove the Truth of the Goſpel by them: and therefore the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which prove the Writings of the Apoſtles in general Divinely Inſpir'd, becauſe they are a ſtanding Rule of Chriſtian Faith, may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to that part of them which conſiſts in explaining the Myſtical Senſe of the Old Teſtament Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings. But concerning the Myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Senſe of the Prophets, I ſhall have an opportunity to ſpeak more fully in the next Chapter. And ſo much may ſuffice for the proof of the third general Head, viz. <hi>That the Aſſiſtance which the holy Spirit gave the Apoſtles was ſomething more than refreſhing their Memories, and recalling to their minds what our Saviour had ſaid unto them.</hi> I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to ſhew</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:93273:55"/>IV. <hi>That the Apoſtles had an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Aſſiſtance when they were ſummon'd before Magiſtrates upon the account of their Religion: and to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate their Behaviour at that time, from the unbecoming and Irreverent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections of this Author.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One would think the words of our Saviour were plain enough in this point<note n="u" place="margin">Matt. 10.19, 20. Mark 13.11.</note>: <hi>Take no thought before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand what ye ſhall ſpeak: for it ſhall be given you in the ſame hour what ye ought to ſay: for 'tis not ye that ſpeak, but the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> ſays <hi>S. Mark, the Spirit of your Father,</hi> ſaith <hi>S. Matthew, ſpeaks in you.</hi> If this had been only a <hi>Spirit of Courage and Holineſs ariſing from the Belief of the Goſpel,</hi> as Mr. <hi>N.</hi> pretends<note n="w" place="margin">Fr. <hi>p.</hi> 241. Eng. <hi>p.</hi> 44.</note>, 'twould have requir'd a great deal of Care, Conſideration and Reflection, to keep it warm upon their Hearts, that it might not cool when dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger approached. And our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's precluding the uſe of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane means, proves that it was ſomething more than an ordinary Grace, which always requires the Cooperation of our Natural Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties:
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:93273:56"/>
and ſhews that 'twas as much a new Impulſe which the Apoſtles were to feel upon their minds on ſuch occaſions, as any Prophetick Inſpiration whatſoever. But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the plain import of the words, rather than own an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Inſpiration, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural force of the words muſt be dwindled away into nothing, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pretence of their being on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>a Hebrew way of ſpeaking</hi>
               <note n="x" place="margin">Fr. <hi>p.</hi> 244 Eng. <hi>p.</hi> 49.</note>, like <hi>The Spirit of jealouſie, of ſlumber,</hi> &amp;c. which are found in the Old Teſtament. As if there was no difference in the nature of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion between the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> or the <hi>Spirit of the Father,</hi> and the <hi>ſpirit of jealouſie</hi> or <hi>ſtupidity.</hi> But this is the conſtant method of our <hi>New Interpreters</hi> of Scripture, that don't care to believe any thing to be there, but what Natural Powers can effect, and Intellectual ones comprehend. When they are preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with plain words of Scripture, they will not out of Good Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, in downright terms deny their Authority, but think it more
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:93273:56"/>
decent to evade it, by explaining away all the force of them, and alledging the <hi>Metaphorical and Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous</hi> way of ſpeaking, which the <hi>Eaſtern Languages</hi> uſe, which ſeems to imply a great deal more in it, than the Writer really deſign'd. Thus <hi>Spinoza</hi> tells us<note n="y" place="margin">
                  <hi>Theol. Polit.</hi> c. 6.</note>, that tho there are wonderful ſtories told in the old Teſtament, yet that is no proof that the things themſelves were Miraculous, or ſuch as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the power of Natural A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, for the Jews loved to talk big, and make a great deal more of a ſtory by their way of telling it, than the matter of Fact really was. Juſt ſo the <hi>Socinians</hi> when they are preſſed with plain Texts of Scripture for the Divinity or Satisfaction of Chriſt, make this their conſtant Refuge, <hi>that the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Language is full of Metaphors,</hi> and the Writers don't mean half ſo much as they ſay. Now this is an excellent device to render the Scriptures an inſignificant Book, or which is much the ſame, make it ſay whatever theſe New Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:93273:57"/>
pleaſe. But before this trick will paſs, theſe Gentlemen ſhould convince us, that ſince 'tis impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to know the meaning of the Scripture by the words, 'tis they only have the ſecret of telling us its true Senſe, and the Key to theſe Myſtical Characters.</p>
            <p>And here I ſhall take occaſion to reflect upon another paſſage in theſe <hi>Letters,</hi> which indeed belongs to the Subject treated of in the former part of this Chapter, viz. <hi>Concerning the Aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt which our Saviour promiſed his Diſciples:</hi> but being another Eſſay of our Author's dexterity in this new way of Interpreting Scripture, I choſe to make my remarks upon it in this place. 'Tis his gloſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that place of St. <hi>John</hi>
               <note n="z" place="margin">Joh. 16.13, 14, 15.</note>, <hi>He ſhall not ſpeak of himſelf, but whatſoever he ſhall hear that ſhall he ſpeak,</hi> &amp;c. He obſerves<note n="a" place="margin">Fr. <hi>p.</hi> 254. En. <hi>p.</hi> 66.</note> that <q>theſe words muſt be extremely figurative, becauſe the Holy Ghoſt properly ſpeaking, did not hear from God or Jeſus Chriſt, that which he was to Inſpire the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles with.</q> From whence it muſt
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:93273:57"/>
follow, (or elſe this Obſervation of his is Impertinent) that the words immediately foregoing<note n="b" place="margin">John 16.13.</note>, <hi>When the Spirit of truth is come, he will guide you into all truth,</hi> muſt be very Figurative too, and not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that the Spirit really taught the Apoſtles any thing in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Senſe. Now to paſs by this Conſequence of his, <hi>viz.</hi> that plain words are to be underſtood Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorically, becauſe they are joyn'd with words that have a Metaphor in them, I can't but obſerve thus much for the clearing the ſenſe of this Text, that our Saviour uſes no other expreſſions concerning the Holy Spirit here, than what he had often uſed before of himſelf, when he ſo often ſays, that <hi>what he taught he had heard and received from the Father</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">John 5.30. c. 8.26.40 c. 15.15.</note>. And I hope 'twill be granted that our Saviour taught his Diſciples in a proper Senſe, without a Metaphor: and why then muſt it follow from this way of ſpeaking, that the Holy Ghoſt did not?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:93273:58"/>But to return to our preſent ſubject. "<hi>That</hi> he ſays,<note n="b" place="margin">Fr. p. 241. En. <hi>p.</hi> 44.</note> 
               <hi>which inclines him to believe that the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd Promiſe of our Saviour,</hi> the Holy Ghoſt, or Spirit of the Father, ſhall teach you in that hour what ye ought to ſay, <hi>means no more then this,</hi> viz. <hi>The Spirit of Courage and Holineſs which the Goſpel produces in your hearts, will teach you what ye ought to ſay, is, That in comparing this Promiſe with the Event, it ſeems not to have been perform'd in any other ſenſe than what he has now given.</hi> But has he indeed compar'd it with all the Events mention'd in the Hiſtory of the <hi>Acts?</hi> Not at all: only has pick'd out two Inſtances, which he thought he could make Exceptions againſt. Sure if he had dealt fairly and impartially in this matter, he would not have paſs'd by the <hi>Boldneſs of Peter and John</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">Act. 4.13.</note>, which was ſo Extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it made the. <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> wonder: nor the Couragious Behaviour of all the Apoſtles<note n="d" place="margin">Act. 5.29.</note>: in both which Caſes the Apoſtles told the <hi>Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drim</hi>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:93273:58"/>
to their faces, of their Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Sin in Murdering the Meſſias, and that there was no way to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, but by Believing in him whom they had Crucified. The Event in both theſe Caſes ſeems to come up to the higheſt Senſe of our Savior's Words: and if we had an exact Hiſtory of the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of the Apoſtles, I do not queſtion but we ſhould find many more Proofs of the Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Promiſe. Since in thoſe few Remains that we have of the <hi>Genuine Acts</hi> of the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,</hi> there are eminent Inſtances of their Courage in Profeſſing the Truth,<note n="e" place="margin">v Acta Ignat. per Uſſerium Edit.

I am ſure <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> confeſſes that this very Argument prevail'd with him to embrace the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.<note n="f" place="margin">Apol. 1.</note> And if the Behaviour of the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:93273:59"/>
Martyrs in aftertimes was ſo Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, we cannot think that the Apoſtles were in this reſpect Inferiour to their Diſciples. Now a man that had a real Concern for the honour of our Saviour and his Apoſtles, and was deſirous to magnify the Power of God's Grace, and ſet it in the beſt Light he could, would not have paſs'd over all the Evidences for it, and only inſiſted upon thoſe Inſtances, which he thought would leſſen and obſcure it.</p>
            <p>But let us ſee whether the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances he brings, do really ſo much leſſen the Promiſe of our Saviour as he imagines. As for St. <hi>Paul's Behaviour to the High Prieſt</hi>
               <note n="g" place="margin">Act. 23.3.</note>, which is our Author's firſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance<note n="h" place="margin">Fr. p. 241. Eng. p. 45.</note>, he cannot be ignorant that ſome Expoſitors of the beſt Note<note n="i" place="margin">Grot. Eſtius. Beza.</note>, as well as his Adverſary Mr. <hi>Simon</hi>
               <note n="k" place="margin">Eng. p. 178. Fr. p. 259.</note>, underſtand thoſe words of his, <hi>God ſhall ſmite thee thou whited wall,</hi> as ſpoken by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and in the Style of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, as our Saviour call'd <hi>Herod Fox</hi>
               <note n="l" place="margin">Luk. 13.32.</note>, and St. <hi>Paul</hi> call'd <hi>Nero Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
               <note n="m" place="margin">2 Tim. 4.17.</note>.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:93273:59"/>
And they that maintain this O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, do not ſuppoſe that St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the next words beg'd Pardon, and confeſs'd that he was to blame for what he ſaid, as our Author takes for granted that he did<note n="ſ" place="margin">Ubi ſup.</note>. But they take this to be the real Senſe of the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
               <hi>v.</hi> tho purpoſely concealed under ambiguous Terms, <q>I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not believe or own ſuch a man to be High Prieſt, who came into his Place by thoſe ill Acts as <hi>Ananias</hi> did, for if I had look'd upon him as High Prieſt, I ſhould not have tranſgreſſed the Law, in giving him ſuch diſreſpectful Language.</q> But if we underſtand the Place in the ſame Senſe which Mr. <hi>N.</hi> does, and own the Apoſtle to have been ſurpriz'd by Paſſion, yet ſtill there will appear evident Tokens of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Aſſiſtance accompanying him, if we take an entire View of the whole hiſtory of his Sufferings at Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem: With what an Undaunted Reſolution he went thither, when he knew beforehand, <hi>That Bonds and Afflictions did abide him, and did not value his Life, ſo he might

finiſh his Courſe with joy</hi>
               <note n="o" place="margin">Acc. 20.23, 24.</note> How he perſiſted in the ſame Reſolution, notwithſtanding all the Importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities and Tears of his Friends, being <hi>ready not only to be bound at Jeruſalem, but alſo to die for the Name of the Lord Jeſus:</hi>
               <note n="p" place="margin">Act. 21.14.</note> with what Courage he ſets forth the Grounds of his Converſion before the enrag'd Multitude<note n="q" place="margin">Act. 22.</note>: with what Authority he Preach'd concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Faith in Chriſt, and the Fundamentals of Chriſtianity to <hi>Felix,</hi> and laid his Sins ſo home to him that he made him <hi>tremble</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 24.25.</note>: How powerfully he pleaded for himſelf and his Religion before <hi>Agrippa</hi>
               <note n="r" place="margin">Act. 26.</note>, ſo as to make Impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon the King himſelf, <hi>and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt perſwade him to be a Chriſtian.</hi> He that ſhall lay all theſe things together, will ſee Reaſon to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the Power of God's Grace in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Behaviour at <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem:</hi> and will not think that that one Slip, if it were one, is able to obſcure the Glory of all the other parts of it.</p>
            <p>And as for that Prudential Act of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:93273:60"/>
St. <hi>Paul,</hi> which our Author ſayes<note n="ſ" place="margin">Fr. p. 242. Eng. p. 46.</note> 
               <hi>hath nothing of Inſpiration in it,</hi> viz. his dividing the Council<note n="t" place="margin">Act. 23.6.</note>, and thereby making one half of them his Friends; 'twas exactly agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to our Savior's Advice to the Apoſtles<note n="u" place="margin">Matth. 10.16.</note>, <hi>To uſe all Prudence that was conſiſtent with Innocency,</hi> as this certainly was. But beſides, it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied an excellent Argument <hi>ad homines,</hi> viz. to Jews, in behalf of Chriſtianity, namely, that it was unreaſonable for them to reject that Religion, or perſecute the Abetters of it, whoſe great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign 'tis to eſtabliſh the Doctrine of the Reſurrection, the Belief of which Point, the chiefeſt of their own Sects for Reputation look'd upon as one of the principal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of their Faith. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we find St. <hi>Paul,</hi> knowing what force there was in it, inſiſt again and again upon the very ſame Apology for himſelf<note n="x" place="margin">Act. 24.15. -c. 26.6, 7. -c. 28.20.</note>. Nay God himſelf approved of it, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the <hi>Viſion</hi> which St. <hi>Paul</hi> had to incourage him the very next night after his Appearance
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:93273:61"/>
before the Council, by which our Lord himſelf gave Teſtimony to him, that he had witneſs'd a good Confeſſion<note n="y" place="margin">Act. 23.11.</note>.</p>
            <p>But 'tis a wonder to me that our<note n="z" place="margin">Fr. p. 243. Eng. p. 48.49.</note> Author ſhould think St. <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi>'s Behaviour and Harangue<note n="b" place="margin">Act. 7</note> a proper Inſtance, to ſhew that the Apoſtles and primitive Confeſſors had no immediate Aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt, when they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd before ſecular Magiſtrates. For if Courage to ſpeak the Truth, and to back it with unanſwerable Arguments, be a ſign of an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Aſſiſtance, certainly no perſon ever gave greater Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of it than St. <hi>Stephen.</hi> To declare publickly that the <hi>Temple and its Worſhip ſhould ſhortly be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">Act. 6.14.</note> was ſuch an Invidious Truth, that the Apoſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves did not think fit at firſt to ſpeak it openly, but ſhew'd a great reſpect to the eſtabliſh'd Worſhip, by conſtantly attending upon it<note n="d" place="margin">Act. 3.1.-18.21.-20 16.-21 26.</note>. The Diſſolution of the Moſaical Oeconomy, being a Truth that the new Converts from Judaiſm were
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:93273:61"/>
not yet able to bear. But even this Truth St. <hi>Stephen</hi> had the Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to profeſs, and maintain'd it too by a continued ſeries of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, from <hi>Abraham</hi> whom the Jews boaſted to be their Father, down to the building of the Temple. Wherein he ſhews that the Patriarchs and Founders of the Jewiſh Nation, were accepted by God before the Temple or its Service had a Beginning: nay that <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf the Inſtitutor of this Worſhip, prophecied of <hi>Chriſt</hi>
               <note n="e" place="margin">Acts 7.37.</note>, and deſign'd the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle only for a <hi>Pattern of Heavenly things</hi>
               <note n="f" place="margin">Ibid ver. 44.</note>. Beſides this St. <hi>Stephen</hi> all along made Reflections upon the ſtubborn and refractory Temper of the Jews from the beginning, and told them that their Reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Murdering of Chriſt when he came, was but agreeable to their uſage of the Prophets who foretold him<note n="g" place="margin">Ib. ver. 52.</note>. I think he that ſaid theſe things had the Gift of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which the Apoſtles pray'd for<note n="h" place="margin">Acts 4.29.</note>, in a great meaſure. And tho our Author is pleas'd to ſay,<note n="i" place="margin">Ubi ſupr.</note> that
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:93273:62"/>
               <hi>St. Stephen mentions divers Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Hiſtory which were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpoſe,</hi> yet for my part I muſt declare I ſee none but what are neceſſary to make it a full and Complete Narrative, or elſe ſerve to ſet forth the ill manners of the Jews under the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Diſpenſations of Providence. And I am apt to think St. <hi>Luke</hi> was of the ſame mind: for ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracting from his Divine Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter, he was too Judicious a man to trouble himſelf or his Reader, with a Rehearſal of impertinent Circumſtances. I am ſure there are ſeveral particulars which are of great uſe to explain the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of <hi>Moſes</hi>
               <note n="k" place="margin">Acts 7.20,—26.</note>, which we could never have known, if this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe had not been preſerv'd. This Gentleman may call theſe <hi>Impertinencies</hi> if he pleaſes, but I believe few will follow him in this bold and Unſcholar-like Cenſure, and 'tis well St: <hi>Luke</hi> was of another mind, for we ſhould have had a great Loſs, if he had not preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them. And as for thoſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:93273:62"/>
which he ſays<note n="l" place="margin">Ubi ſupr.</note> 
               <hi>cannot be reconciled with the Hiſtory of the Old Teſtament</hi>
               <note n="m" place="margin">Acts 7.16.</note>, if S. <hi>Luke</hi> made theſe Miſtakes, they have been accounted for above:<note n="n" place="margin">Supr. <hi>p.</hi> 45, 46.</note> if St. <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi> himſelf did, I ſuppoſe the ſame Defence that is made for a Writer, will hold more ſtrongly for a Speaker. And tho we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe St. <hi>Stephen</hi> to have been <hi>full of the Holy Ghoſt</hi> when he ſpake<note n="o" place="margin">Acts 6.10.-7.55.</note>, yet there's no reaſon the Spirit ſhould dictate a Hiſtory to him, which he was before ſo well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with. And why may we not ſay, that although the Holy Spirit were ſo remarkably preſent with him at this time, that the Glories which were ſhed forth upon his Soul, ſhin'd thro his Body, and made <hi>his face look like the face of an Angel</hi>
               <note n="p" place="margin">Acts 6.15.</note>, yet the Holy Ghoſt thought fit not to ſupply the Defect of his Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in one or two particulars, to ſhew that Inſpir'd perſons, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in their Brighteſt Minutes, are ſtill but men, and that the <hi>Excellency might appear to be of

            <p>What has been ſaid is ſufficient to ſhew what little ground there is for this Author's unworthy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, upon the Behaviour of the Firſt Chriſtians before the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Tribunals, wherein he ſeems not only to attack two or three Paſſages of Scripture, but to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to overthrow one of the principal Arguments for the Truth of Chriſtianity: for certainly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was there greater Evidence of a Divine Power preſent with its Profeſſors, than when they were ſummon'd before the Magiſtrates, to give a <hi>reaſon of the Hope that was in them.</hi> I proceed in the</p>
            <p n="5">V<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. place, <hi>to Anſwer the Objections which he has advanc'd againſt the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration of the Apoſtles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt which I ſhall take notice of is, <hi>The Apoſtles Diſputing and Conferring with each other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they came to a Reſolution at the Synod of Jeruſalem</hi>
               <note n="q" place="margin">Fr. p. 248, 249. Eng. p. 57.</note>: which he thinks was needleſs among per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons Inſpir'd. As likewiſe that <hi>Prophets ſhould ſubmit what they ſay,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:93273:63"/>
to the Judgment of other Prophets,</hi> according to St. <hi>Paul's order</hi>
               <note n="r" place="margin">1 Cor. 14.29.</note>.</p>
            <p>But the force of this Objection will be taken away, if we conſider that God diſtributed his <hi>Gifts to each perſon ſeverally as he thought fit</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. 12 11.</note>: ſo that even the greateſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles might think it neceſſary to adviſe with their Brethren in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Conſequence, where the Edification and Peace of the whole Church was nearly concern'd. And indeed one reaſon why God gave his Spirit <hi>by Meaſure</hi> to them ſeems to be this, that he deſign'd to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage all the Members of the Church into a ſtrict Union and Alliance with each other by this means, becauſe they ſtood in need of one another's help and direction: and <hi>the eye could not ſay to the hand, I have no need of thee; nor the head to the feet, I have no need of you</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">Ibid. v. 21.</note>: i. e. the more Eminent Members of the Church very often ſtood in need of the Aſſiſtance and Direction of the Inferior and leſs conſiderable ones. And accordingly we find the Apoſtles and Heads of the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:93273:64"/>
Church were inform'd by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior and more ordinary Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of it, of ſeveral particulars they were ignorant of before: ſo <hi>Agabus</hi> inform'd St. <hi>Paul</hi> of his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">Act. 21.11.</note>, and the <hi>Holy Ghoſt witneſs'd the ſame in every City</hi>
               <note n="d" place="margin">Act. 20.23.</note>, no doubt by perſons of a much Inferior ſtation in the Church than St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf. Thus the diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of Spiritual Gifts in different Meaſures and Degrees, was very effectual to prevent <hi>Schiſm in the Body</hi>
               <note n="e" place="margin">1 Cor. 12.25.</note> of the Church, and to oblige the <hi>Members to have the ſame care one for another.</hi> And we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to this purpoſe, that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour made an eſpecial promiſe of his preſence among his Diſciples, <hi>where two or three are gather'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
               <note n="f" place="margin">Matth. 18.2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Spirit in the bond of peace,</hi> and not to <hi>forſake the Aſſembling themſelves together.</hi> And as by their exerciſing their gifts in the publick Aſſemblies, each Man's private gifts were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in Common, and made ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to the Church in general:
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:93273:64"/>
ſo this prevented Falſe Prophets creeping in among them, becauſe they would preſently be detected. Whereas if private Prophecying had been in uſe, an Impoſtor might have took his opportunity, and by impoſing upon the weaker ſort, have got ſuch a reputation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Cheat could have been diſcovered, that it would have been difficult afterward to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd Men of the Impoſture. But by making every one that pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Inſpiration undergo a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Tryal, a falſe Prophet could not hope to eſcape long without being <hi>convinc'd by all and Judg'd by all.</hi> And this ſhews the reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of that Command of St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> that the <hi>Prophets ſhould ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit what they ſay to the judgement of their Brethren</hi>
               <note n="g" place="margin">1 Cor. 14.29.</note>: for ſince from the very beginning there were <hi>Falſe Prophets and deceitful Workers, who</hi> indeavour'd to <hi>transform themſelves into the true Apoſtles and Meſſengers of Chriſt</hi>
               <note n="h" place="margin">2 Cor. 11.13.</note>; the Apoſtles thought fit to lay down Rules for the <hi>Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſpirits</hi>
               <note n="i" place="margin">1 Cor. 12.3. 1 Joh. 4 1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note>: <hi>and the diſcerning of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:93273:65"/>
ſpirits</hi> was a particular Gift deſign'd for this purpoſe<note n="k" place="margin">1 Cor. 12 10.</note>. Now the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt way of doing this, was by the joynt advice of the Governors of the Church aſſembled together, as we find the Biſhops of <hi>Aſia</hi> meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together, diſcovered the falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Montanus</hi> and his Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers pretences to Prophecy<note n="l" place="margin">v. Euſeb. II. E. l. <hi>5.</hi> c <hi>16.19.</hi>
               </note>. To all which we may add, that beſides the uſefulneſs of this method to ſecure the Church againſt Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, it has this further advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in it, that what ſeveral In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpir'd perſons did agree in, brought along with it greater evidence of its coming from God, than if it had been deliver'd only by one. For tho every thing which comes from God, deſerves equal Credit in <hi>It ſelf,</hi> yet there may be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er evidence to <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s</hi> of the Divine Original of one Doctrine, than of another<note n="m" place="margin">v. <hi>Cl.

And as there were greater and more evident proofs of the Divine Miſſion of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, than of the Prophets in the Chriſtian Church, and therefore the Apoſtles had the Precedence of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:93273:65"/>
the Prophets<note n="n" place="margin">1 Cor 12.28</note>, and the Prophets were to ſubmit to their Orders, and Regulate their Gifts by their Injunctions<note n="o" place="margin">1 Cor. 14.3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note>, tho what a true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſpoke was as much the word of God as what an Apoſtle did: ſo in like manner, that which was confirm'd by the concurring Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of Two or Three Inſpir'd Witneſſes, brought greater evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of its Divine Authority, than that which relyed wholly upon the Credit and Integrity of One, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe two or three were leſs lyable to miſtake than one. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we find our Saviour himſelf argues from the common Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Men, and appeals to the concurring Teſtimony of <hi>John</hi>
               <note n="p" place="margin">Joh. 5.33.</note> as a Corroborating Evidence, tho his Miracles ſufficiently proved the truth of his Miſſion: nay he reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that the joint Teſtimony of his Father and himſelf is more cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, (Humanely ſpeaking) than either of them ſingly<note n="q" place="margin">Joh 8 17, 18.</note>.</p>
            <p>And what has been ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Inſpir'd perſons of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior Rank, holds true of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:93273:66"/>
themſelves: for tho I make no queſtion, but the Holy Ghoſt was always ſo far preſent with them, as to guide and direct them in all matters that were of Conſequence, ſuch as that was which gave occaſion to the Synod at <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> yet to make them ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of this Aſſiſtance, we muſt ſuppoſe that they obſerved thoſe Rules of our Saviour, which were neceſſary Conditions in order to the procuring this Aſſiſtance, one of which, as I have obſerv'd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, was their Aſſembling toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther when they had opportunity, and where the Caſe concern'd the whole Church in general. And ſince the Apoſtles themſelves did but <hi>know in part,</hi> and <hi>propheſie in part</hi>
               <note n="r" place="margin">1 Cor. 13.9.</note>, and conſequently might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive further Light from others, what the whole <hi>College</hi> of Apoſtles agreed in, came with greater Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Evidence of it's being God's Will, than what was deliver'd by one Apoſtle only. Juſt as we are more aſſur'd of the Truth of thoſe Doctrines which are often repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:93273:66"/>
by different Writers in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture, than of thoſe which are only mention'd by one: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Authority of ſeveral Writers adds weight to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it ſelf, and the comparing them together prevents our miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the ſenſe of the Scripture con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it; whereas what is but once mention'd is more liable to Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guities, and the Senſe of it more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily miſtaken. From what has been ſaid, I hope it appears that there is ſufficient reaſon why Inſpir'd per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſhould conſult each other; and that this is no prejudice to their Inſpiration.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond Objection is,<note n="ſ" place="margin">Fr p. 249. Eng p 58.</note> 
               <hi>That the Holy Ghoſt which the Apoſtles received on the day of Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecoſt had not taught them all they ought to know, ſo far was it from rendring them at firſt daſh Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libe, ſo that St. Peter needed a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to learn that he ought not to ſcruple Preaching the Goſpel to the Gentiles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do not know any body that ever yet maintain'd that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:93273:67"/>
once for all inſtructed the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles in all things that were needful for the Diſcharge of their Office. 'Tis certain ſeveral things were reveal'd to them by Degrees, and in proportion to the Exigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Church: and this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor himſelf owns as much, when he tells us, <q>
                  <note n="t" place="margin">Fr. p. 252. Eng. p. 62.</note>That the Apoſtles had <hi>MANY</hi> Immediate Revelations and <hi>DIVERS</hi> Heavenly Viſions.</q> And as for the Deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt upon them, in a viſible man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner on the day of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> the chief Deſign of that was publickly to Authorize them to preach the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and to Initiate them into the Body of Chriſt's Church, which was then founded, and to do this by more ſolemn Tokens of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Preſence among the firſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, than any other Inſtitution could ever pretend to: according to what the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> foretold<note n="u" place="margin">Matth. 3.11.</note>, and our Savior promis'd<note n="x" place="margin">Act. 1.5.</note>, that <hi>John indeed baptized,</hi> or admitted Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes with the bare Ceremony of <hi>Water,</hi> (which had been a Rite made uſe of by the Jews long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:93273:67"/>
upon ſuch occaſions) but the <hi>Apoſtles ſhould be Baptized</hi> or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the Church <hi>with the Holy Ghoſt and with fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The third Objection is, that <q>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Fr. p. 248. Eng. p. 57.</note> When the Diſpute aroſe whether the Gentiles that were Converted were to be Circumciſed or not, tho St. Paul and St. Barnabas were againſt this, yet their Authority was not ſufficient to put to ſilence the Judaizing Chriſtians, which was a ſign they did not look upon them as Infallible.</q> To the ſame purpoſe he urges, <q>
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Fr. p. 249. Eng. p. 58.</note> The Believers that were of the Circumciſion contending with St. Peter for going to men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſed and converſing with them<note n="c" place="margin">Act. 11 2, 3.</note>.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To begin with the latter part of the Objection: to the inſtance of St. <hi>Peter</hi> I anſwer, that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts of the Circumciſion were throughly perſwaded, that the Laws and Inſtitutions of <hi>Moſes</hi> were of perpetual Obligation, and therefore 'tis no wonder if at firſt they were ſurpriz'd to ſee any of them laid aſide, and a door open'd
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:93273:68"/>
to let in the Gentiles to the ſame Privileges with the Jews, and to take away that Diſcrimination which the Law makes between the Jews and the reſt of the world<note n="d" place="margin">Exod. 19.5, 6. Deut. 7.6.</note>. And ſince this Action of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s touch'd them ſo near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their Privileges and Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, or at leaſt was contrary to the Traditions they had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from their Teachers, and held as ſacred as the Law it ſelf<note n="*" place="margin">Matt. 15.2. Mat. 7.3. Joh. 18.28.</note>, 'tis no wonder they were not eaſily ſatisfied about it, till they exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd the reaſons upon which St. <hi>Peter</hi> acted in this matter. And the Apoſtles never laid ſo much ſtreſs upon their Infallibility, as to require their Diſciples to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them upon their own word,</hi> as Mr. <hi>N.</hi> himſelf<note n="e" place="margin">Fr. p. 283. Eng. p. 112.</note> obſerves: or without demanding a reaſon why they did ſo. But if we ſhould grant all this Objection contends for, certainly 'tis but a weak Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that the Apoſtles were not Infallible, becauſe ſome new Converts<note n="f" place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Dodwel</hi> of Schiſm ch. 19. ſect. 18, 19.</note> did not think ſo, who 'tis plain did not well underſtand
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:93273:68"/>
the Principles of their own Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and had not as yet intirely ſubmitted to the Authority of the Apoſtles. And by the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon we may argue that our Saviour was not Infallible, (which yet Mr. <hi>N.</hi> himſelf looks upon<note n="g" place="margin">Fr. p. 257, 260, 281. Eng. p. 70, 75, 109.</note> as a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Truth) becauſe his Diſciples ſeem not to be ſatisfied ſometimes of the Truth of what he ſayes<note n="h" place="margin">Matth. 16.22.</note>, and demand of him a reaſon<note n="i" place="margin">Matth 15.15.</note> of thoſe Doctrines of his that look'd like Paradoxes to them.</p>
            <p>A great deal of what has been ſaid will hold much ſtronger in the caſe of St. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi>
               <note n="k" place="margin">Act 15.</note>: for the admitting the Gentiles into the Church without Circumciſion, muſt needs be thought a great Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> by thoſe that look'd upon it to be of perpetual Obligation in the Church of God. To which may be added, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas</hi> had not ſo clear and indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable an Authority as the reſt of the Apoſtles: not being of the number of the Twelve, whoſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion was ſo ſolemnly ſeal'd and
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:93273:69"/>
ratified on the day of <hi>Pentecoſt.</hi> And they who were of a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Perſwaſion from them, would in all likelyhood lay hold of this Objection againſt their Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as Men are willing to take advantage of any Exception to an Authority that is againſt them. And accordingly we find in after times, when the Judaizing Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians found St. <hi>Paul</hi> zealous in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting the Liberties of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Converts, and teaching men every where to <hi>Apoſtatize from Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> as they term'd it<note n="l" place="margin">

            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The fourth Objection is,<note n="m" place="margin">Fr. p. 250. Eng. p. 60.</note> St. <hi>Peter's Diſſimulation at Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och, for which St. Paul reproved him,</hi> as he tells us<note n="n" place="margin">Gal. 2.11.</note>.</p>
            <p>And here I agree with our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:93273:69"/>
that St. <hi>Peter acted contrary to his Judgment, and diſſembled his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion:</hi> for he that had been war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by a Viſion<note n="o" place="margin">Act. 10.28.</note>, <hi>that he ſhould not call any man common or unclean,</hi> and but juſt before had a great hand in making the Decree at the <hi>Synod</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>
               <note n="p" place="margin">Act. 15 7.</note>, whereby the Gentiles were made Members of the Church upon even terms with the Jews, without taking the Yoke of the Law upon them: he after all this could not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally perſwaded in his judgment, that he ought not to keep com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with the Gentile Converts: tho his former prejudices might put ſome weight into the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite Scale, and make him doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and wavering. Which might make his fear of diſpleaſing the Jewiſh Chriſtians, and giving them offence, work more powerfully upon him, and prevail with him to comply with them in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: and St. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſly aſſigns his <hi>fearing</hi> [to offend] <hi>them of the Circumciſion</hi>
               <note n="q" place="margin">Gal. 2 12.</note>, as the cauſe of this his Behaviour. But tho this be
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:93273:70"/>
not a ſufficient Reaſon why any man ſhould diſſemble the Truth, yet we may obſerve from St. <hi>James</hi>'s Advice to St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note n="r" place="margin">Act. 21.20.</note> that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles were very tender of giving any offence to the Jewiſh Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, who were very<note n="ſ" place="margin">

Rom. 15.27.</note>. This may be pleaded for an Excuſe in behalf of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> tho ſtill we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs as St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us<note n="u" place="margin">Gal. 2.14.</note>, <hi>that he did not walk uprightly according to the truth of the Goſpel,</hi> in this matter. And neither the Apoſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nor any in their behalf, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver pretended that they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from ſin: but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, we find them freely own themſelves to be <hi>men of like Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions with others</hi>

               <note n="y" place="margin">2 Cor. 4.7.</note>, and were of the ſame make with other men. And therefore, ſince as our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:93273:70"/>
truly ſays<note n="z" place="margin">Fr. p. 260. Eng. p. 75.</note>, <hi>He alone is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with an abſolute Infallibility, who is incapable of ſinning,</hi> I do freely grant that we are no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aſſur'd that the Apoſtles were free from Errour, than we find them free from Sin, which natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally leads men into it. I own likewiſe that this Inſtance of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> is a good Argument againſt the perpetual Inſpiration or Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility of the Apoſtles, if we mean any more by it, than a habitual Knowledge of Divine Truth: for I cannot think S. <hi>Peter</hi> was under the immediate Conduct of the Holy Spirit, when he was guilty of this Behaviour. But I ſuppoſe the Apoſtles might have ſuch an Aſſiſtance as was abundantly ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to anſwer all the Neceſſities of the Church, without being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways under the immediate Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Holy Ghoſt, which muſt make them Impeccable as as well as Infallible. And even in this caſe we have reaſon to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire God's Providence and Care over his Church, for ſo ordering

it, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould be upon the place to interpoſe and put a ſtop to this ill Conduct, that might elſe have been of dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Conſequence, and made a Breach in the Church that would not eaſily have been made up. And humanely ſpeaking, 'tis not likely that St. <hi>Peter</hi> who had ſuch a Preeminence in the Church, would have yielded to a leſs Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority than that of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s. From whence too may further ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear of what uſe 'twas even for Inſpir'd perſons to conſult with each other, and act by common Advice: which Point I have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained and proved at large a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove<note n="*" place="margin">P. 88.</note>.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The next Exception I ſhall take notice of is this: Mr. <hi>N.</hi> tells us<note n="a" place="margin">Fr. p. 258, 259. Eng. p. 72, 73, 74.</note>, <hi>that the Gift of Wiſdom and Knowledge, or the Gift of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cying,</hi> which he makes all one with the two former, <hi>was a Diſpoſition of mind which God ſometimes infuſed into thoſe on whom he beſtowed it: whereby they became fit to inſtruct,</hi> and that it <hi>did not conſiſt in an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:93273:71"/>
Inſpiration of what they were to ſay.</hi> His reaſons for this are two: 1. <hi>Becauſe this Gift might be improved by Study and Reading,</hi> as he proves from 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.13, 14. 2. <hi>Becauſe the Apoſtle gave directions to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and order'd them to exerciſe their Gifts by turns,</hi> to prevent that Confuſion which the diſorderly Uſe of their Gifts had brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church<note n="b" place="margin">1 Cor. 14.</note>. Now he thinks that if <hi>the Spirit had Inſpir'd them with what to ſay, he would likewiſe have given them directions as to the time and place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now methinks he that can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the Gifts of <hi>Wiſdom, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Prophecy,</hi> which any Man that conſults the place where St. <hi>Paul</hi> reckons up the ſeveral Gifts of the Spirit<note n="c" place="margin">1 Cor. 8, 9.</note> will ſee are diſtinct, and takes no notice of the Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guity of the word <hi>Prophecy,</hi> which is taken in ſeveral Senſes in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture: I ſay he that confounds things, that any one who has ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died the places of Scripture which treat of the Gifts of the Spirit, muſt needs know to be very different,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:93273:72"/>
need not have been ſo nice as to diſtinguiſh between <q>a Diſpoſition of mind infus'd into thoſe upon whom God beſtowed it, whereby they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came fit to Inſtruct, and an Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them with what to ſay.</q> For certainly this <hi>Diſpoſition infuſed into the mind,</hi> if it mean any thing, muſt mean God's giving Men a clear and diſtinct apprehenſion of what they were to teach others; and I think this is much the ſame as Inſpiring them with what to ſay, ſince <hi>out of the abundance of the heart the mouth ſpeaketh,</hi> and words are only the Expreſſions of our thoughts: unleſs our Author ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, that when God Inſpires a Man with what to ſay, he only puts ſo many words into his mouth, without conveying any Idea of the things themſelves to his mind. But let us proceed to examine his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
            <p>As to the Firſt, I ſee no incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience in aſſerting, that God very often increas'd or withheld his Extraordinary Gifts, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the Induſtry of the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſors.
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:93273:72"/>
For ſince the Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and Ordinary Gifts agree in this, that they are both deſign'd to aſſiſt our Natural Faculties, not to ſuperſede them, and to incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage our Induſtry, not to ſlacken it, I can't ſee why that Rule of our Saviour's, <hi>To him that has ſhall be given, and from him that has not, i. e.</hi> does not improve and make a good uſe of what he has, <hi>ſhall be taken way</hi>
               <note n="d" place="margin">Matth. 13.12.</note>, may not be applied to the Extraordinary Gifts as well as to the Ordinary: and why Men might not hope God would beſtow theſe Gifts upon them in a greater degree, as a reward of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry; and might not have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to fear he ſhould withdraw them, if they took advantage from thence to be negligent. And thus much ſeems to be implied in that advice of St. <hi>Paul</hi>
               <note n="e" place="margin">1 Theſſ. 5.19.</note>, <hi>Not to quench the Spirit,</hi> viz. that God may be provok'd to take away theſe Gifts, when he ſees them abuſed: or Men's ſins may render them Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to be the Inſtruments of the holy Spirit. The ſtory of the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:93273:73"/>
               <hi>Ethiopian Eunuch</hi> who was Reading the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi>
               <note n="f" place="margin">Act. 8.</note>, and to whom God ſent <hi>Philip</hi> to inſtruct him, may not unfitly illuſtrate this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Perhaps the utmoſt diligence the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> could uſe, would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have given him a clear Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of that place of the Prophet: but God to reward his Induſtry, ſent him an Inſpir'd In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter to inſtruct him in the meaning of it. And in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner God may reward Men's Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral endeavours to find out the truth, with ſuch degrees of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge as are Supernatural. Nor does his inſtance of the <hi>Miraculous Gift of curing Diſeaſes,</hi> which he ſays<note n="g" place="margin">Ubi ſup.</note>, <hi>can't be increas'd by Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mind,</hi> come up to our caſe. For curing Diſeaſes after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the Apoſtles did, is a Power perfectly beyond the Sphere of Humane ability: whereas the Gifts we ſpeak of, being of an Intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Nature, are moſt of them in ſome meaſure adequate to the Faculties of the Soul, and in ſome degree attainable by Induſtry; ſo
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:93273:73"/>
that in this caſe what is Miraculous in one Man, may be Natural in another. For example, the Gift of ſpeaking in a ſtrange Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage was Miraculous in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, but would not be ſo in a Man that ſhould get the perfect com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the ſame Language by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry. For the illuſtration of this point, I will put this caſe, <hi>viz.</hi> of two men, one of them arriv'd to a good degree of Learning by ſtudy, and the other Illiterate: ſuppoſing theſe two to have equal skill in expounding Scripture; this gift would be thought to proceed from Natural cauſes in the Former, but would be miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in the Latter: now putting this Caſe, 'tis no Incongruity to ſuppoſe that God ſhould reward the Induſtry of the Former with a degree of Infus'd Knowledge, as much above the Supernatural Indowments of the Latter, as his Natural Talents and acquir'd Knowledge are above the others. For my part I can ſee no abſurdity in ſuppoſing, that God may incourage Men to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove their Natural Talents as
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:93273:74"/>
much as they can, by promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them a proportionable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of Supernatural Knowledge. For this, as has been obſerv'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note n="h" place="margin">
                  <hi>Supr.</hi> p. 37, 38.</note>, is God's conſtant method, to make uſe of Natural means as far as they will go, and than to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply as much as he thinks fit over and above.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As to his Second Reaſon, which is taken from the <hi>Directions the Apoſtle gives to Spiritual perſons,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 'tis plain by that very Chapter, that the Spirit uſually left Gifted Men to themſelves, to exerciſe their Gifts as they thought fit: for the Apoſtle tells them<note n="i" place="margin">1 Cor. 14.32.</note>, <hi>that the Spirits of the Prophets are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Prophets:</hi> and from ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral places of the ſame Chapter<note n="k" place="margin">Verſ. 5. 12, 13, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> it appears, that Men ſpake in Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Tongues in their Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, when there was no body preſent that underſtood the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage they ſpake in. Which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly they would never have done, if they had been under the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate direction of the Spirit as to the uſe of their Gifts. And the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:93273:74"/>
ſpeaking with Tongues Mr. <hi>N.</hi> himſelf owns to be a proper kind of Inſpiration, but ſays<note n="l" place="margin">Fr. p. 267. Eng. p. 87.</note> 
               <hi>that when they thus abus'd their Gifts they did not ſpeak by immediate Inſpiration, but had the ſame command of thoſe Languages, as if they had Learn'd them from their Infancy:</hi> as if a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural Habit were not as much a Gift, as a ſingle Act. And this likewiſe ſhews that the Inſpiration of the Gifted Men in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church, conſiſted rather in a conſtant and permanent Faculty, habitually reſiding in their mind, and exerting it ſelf, either as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt<note n="m" place="margin">Act. 4. 8, 31.</note>, or as they themſelves thought fit<note n="n" place="margin">Act. 17. 16.-18.5.</note>, than in ſuch a kind of Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration as the Prophets had, which was often diſcontinued and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted: which was the reaſon the Latter never ſpake till they felt a New Impulſe, and therefore uſher'd in what they were about to ſay, with <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord,</hi> and left off when that Impulſe ceaſed. And this difference between the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical Inſpiration of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, and the Apoſtolical of
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:93273:75"/>
the New, is a ſufficient reaſon why the Apoſtles never begin their Exhortations or Inſtructions, with <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord,</hi> which yet is thought a good Argument by <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noza</hi>
               <note n="o" place="margin">Theol. Polit. c. 11.</note> againſt the Inſpiration of the Apoſtolical Writings: tho I think 'tis a very weak one; for the prefixing their Names before their Epiſtles, gives them ſufficient Authority, and a juſt Title to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration.</p>
            <p>And now I have run through the moſt conſiderable Objections which this Author has rais'd againſt the Inſpiration of the Apoſtles. I think 'tis hardly worth while to ſpend time in Refuting other little Cavils, as<note n="p" place="margin">Fr. p. 251, 252. Eng. p. 61, 62.</note> 
               <q>that the Apoſtles never ſpeak with the ſame Authority as Chriſt did, but declare they ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of themſelves, and refer all to Chriſt:</q> for ſure 'tis enough for Diſciples to ſpeak in the Name of their Maſter, and 'tis equivalent to the Phraſe of the Prophets, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord.</hi> And the ſame Argument if it prove any thing, will hold againſt the Inſpiration of Chriſt himſelf, becauſe he ſays,

            </p>
            <p>I ſhall not purſue all the Critical Remarks he makes<note n="u" place="margin">Ubi ſup.</note> upon the ſtyle of their <hi>Synodical Letter:</hi> for if their own expreſs words, <hi>[It ſeem'd good to the Holy Ghoſt and to us]</hi> will not perſwade him that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles thought themſelves Aſſiſted with the immediate direction of the Holy Ghoſt in that affair, I I deſpair of convincing him by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing I can ſay. Nor does it follow from hence, that all the perſons preſent were inſpir'd: for
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:93273:76"/>
ſince the Apoſtles preſided over the Aſſembly, and the Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was wholly left to them, if they were Inſpir'd, it was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ſtamp a Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority upon the Determination it ſelf, tho it were publiſh'd in the name of the whole Aſſembly. But 'tis pity the Apoſtles had not had ſome ſuch able Critick as our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor among them, to direct them how to word their Epiſtle, and if Mr. <hi>N.</hi> had been <hi>Secretary</hi> to the Council, no doubt 'twould have been drawn up with much more Exactneſs: tho as great a Critick as himſelf<note n="x" place="margin">

            <p n="1">I. As to the firſt: 'twould in a great meaſure take off mens Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices againſt the prophetical Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, if they would but conſider <hi>what manner of men the Prophets were,</hi> and what excellent Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations they were indowed with. Men that are glad of any Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that makes Religion look like a Cheat, think they have a great Advantage againſt all ſorts of Prophecy, becauſe there have been ſo many Cheats of this kind: and they find that uſually the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that pretend to a prophetick Spirit, are in all other reſpects of ſuch ſhallow Intellectuals, and ſuch mean Qualifications, that no wiſe man would take their Advice in any thing of ordinary concern, and therefore 'tis very unlikely God ſhould make choice of ſuch perſons, to be his Meſſengers and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:93273:77"/>
the Conveyers of his Will to men. But if they would likewiſe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how unlike the Prophets of the Old Teſtament were to theſe Pretenders, both as to their <hi>Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuals,</hi> and their <hi>Morals,</hi> 'twould go a great way to diſcover how vaſtly different they are from each other, and the Truth and Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the one would more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appear, by comparing it with the evident marks of Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture and Meanneſs, which are found in the other.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Intellectual Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of the true Prophets, they had uſually an Ingenuous and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral Education, as appears by the Inſtitution of the <hi>Schools of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> ſo often mention'd in the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of the <hi>Kings.</hi> And we find 'twas reckon'd a wonder that <hi>Saul</hi> ſhould be among the <hi>Prophets</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">1 Sam. 10, 11.-19.24.</note>, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had not been Educated ſuitably to that Profeſſion. So God's calling <hi>Amos</hi> to this Office from being a <hi>Herds-man,</hi> was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary and unuſual, as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf intimates<note n="b" place="margin">Amos 8.14.</note>. And indeed the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:93273:78"/>
ſtyle of the Prophets plainly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers them to have been Men of a good Education, and therefore the Criticks have all obſerved what great difference there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Amos</hi>'s ſtyle and that of the other Prophets, which they juſtly impute to their different Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Iſaiah's</hi> ſtyle is Elegant<note n="c" place="margin">

their Predictions.

            <p n="2">2. If we conſider the <hi>Moral In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments</hi> of the Prophets, we ſhall find their Vertues ſo extraordinary, that none of the Whifling Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders to Prophecy, can in the leaſt compare with them. With what undaunted Courage and Conſtancy did they reprove the Popular Vices of the times they lived in? Not ſparing the Greateſt Perſons either out of fear or flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery. And if we ſuppoſe them to have acted like Men in their Wits, (and ther'es no tolerable reaſon to ſuſpect the contrary,) we muſt conclude that nothing but a Senſe of their Duty, could prompt them
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:93273:80"/>
to do this: for they could propoſe no advantage to themſelves by it, but on the contrary were to expect all the ſcorn and miſery which the Angry and Revengeful Temper of wicked Men in Power whom they had offended, could bring upon them. And it could certainly be no pleaſure to be continually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving Men, when there was lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or no hopes of reclaiming them: nay when they had not ſo much Civility as to thank them for their good Intentions, and take the good Advice which they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd, kindly at their hands.

            <p n="2">II. Place <hi>to conſider the chief Aim and Deſign of God's ſending Prophets to the Jews, and what was the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal End of their Office.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I confeſs I am apt to believe that the occaſion of Gods promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to ſend a ſucceſſion of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets to the Jews, (as many Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men underſtand that place<note n="u" place="margin">Deut. 18.15.</note> of <hi>Deuteronomy</hi>) was, That they might have no Temptation to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the Heathen Oracles and Soothſayers, to know what ſhould come to paſs, for want of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of their own. Thus much
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:93273:82"/>
the words of <hi>Moſes</hi> ſeem to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,<note n="x" place="margin">Ibid. à <hi>v.</hi> 10 ad <hi>v.</hi> 15.</note> 
               <hi>There ſhall not be any among you that uſeth Divination, or an Obſerver of times, or an Enchanter; —for theſe nations whom thou ſhalt poſſeſs hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened to Obſervers of times and to Diviners, but as for thee the Lord thy God hath not ſuffer'd thee ſo to do. The Lord thy God ſhall raiſe thee up a Prophet of thy Brethren, like unto me, unto him ſhall ye hearken.</hi> The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of a Prophet, which tho it emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently relate to the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> yet the Context ſhews it was primarily and immediately meant of an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Prophets that ſhould ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed <hi>Moſes:</hi> this promiſe I ſay, was given to the Jews, as appears from this place, to prevent their applying themſelves to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then pretenders to Prophecy. This is <hi>Origen</hi>'s Obſervation upon this place,<note n="y" place="margin">L. 1. c. Celſum. p. 28. Ed. Cant.</note> and he adds this judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous remark. <hi>Therefore,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>when the nations round about the Jews had their Oracles and ſeveral ways of Divination, all which were ſtrictly prohibited among the Jews, if they had not had the ſatisfaction of
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:93273:83"/>
foreknowing things to come ſome way or other, it had been almoſt impoſſible, conſidering the great Curioſity of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, to have kept them from deſpiſing the Law of</hi> Moſes, <hi>as hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no mark of Divinity upon it, or rejecting the Prophets who ſucceeded him, and taking no care to preſerve their Diſcourſes; or elſe apoſtatizing to the Heathen Oracles, or ſetting up ſomething like them among themſelves. Therefore 'tis no wonder that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets now and then gave anſwers to thoſe that enquir'd of them about or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Accidents, as</hi> Samuel<note n="z" place="margin">1 Sam. 10.2.</note> 
               <hi>told</hi> Saul that his aſſes were found, <hi>and</hi> Ahijah the Prophet<note n="a" place="margin">1 King. 14.12.</note> foretold the death of Jeroboam's ſon. <hi>Or elſe how could they that ſtood up for the Law of</hi> Moſes <hi>reprove them that went to conſult Idols, as we find</hi> Elias<note n="b" place="margin">2 King. 1.3.</note>

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:93273:83"/>
Jews, and likewiſe furniſh us with a very ſatisfactory Reaſon, why the Prophets condeſcended now and then to ſatisfy people's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands about private and trivial Concerns, which ſeem to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Dignity of God's Prophets to meddle with: ſo I don't que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, but God had ſome further deſign in Inſtituting a Succeſſion of Prophets, and charging the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to have a regard to what they ſhould deliver, than meerly to ſatisfy the Jews Curioſity, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their ſeeking to Idols for the Knowledge of Futurities. And I ſuppoſe that the Inſtitution of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets was deſign'd chiefly for theſe Three ends.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>To admoniſh the people of their Duty, and preſs them to practiſe it, by propoſing God's Mercies and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, according as they have behaved themſelves.</hi>

            <p n="1">
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:93273:84"/>1. <hi>The firſt part of the Prophetical Office was to admoniſh the people of their Duty, and perſwade them to practiſe it, by ſetting before them God's Mercies or Judgements, which they would ſuddenly feel, according as they behaved themſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Prophets were principally intended to be <hi>Preachers of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> and generally ſpeaking, foretold future events only in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to make their Exhortations ſucceſsful. And with reſpect to this part of the Prophetical Office, we find the words <hi>Prophet</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy</hi> uſed in the New Teſtament for inſtructing Men in their Duty<note n="c" place="margin">Acts 15.31. Rom. 12. 1 Cor. 6.14.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note>. Without queſtion 'twas properly the Prieſts buſineſs to inſtruct the people in their Duty, and they were <hi>to ſeek the Law at their mouths</hi>
               <note n="d" place="margin">Malac. 2.7.</note>: but the refractory temper of the Jews, made them deſpiſe the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Methods of Reproof and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and their dulneſs withal made it neceſſary for God to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken them out of their ſins, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by an Extraordinary Call from Heaven: by ſending perſons
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:93273:84"/>
upon a particular Meſſage to them, and giving Teſtimony to their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Miſſion by ſome Sign or Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: (which I ſuppoſe was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or Trial of a true Prophet, of which more hereafter) and all this to reinforce the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and Threatnings contain'd in the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and aſſure the Jews he would be as good as his word, and they ſhould quickly find, that as if they would amend their ways, <hi>there ſhould not fail one word of all his good Promiſes,</hi> ſo if they perſiſted in their ill courſes, <hi>all the Evils that were written in the Law of Moſes, ſhould ſuddenly come upon them and overtake them.</hi> And in this reſpect, the Prophecies of the Old Teſtament differ very much from all the Falſe Pretences to Prophecy, that in the Former, fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Events are not foretold meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to pleaſe Men's Curioſity, but only in order to the making them better; whereas the Latter do not make it any part of their concern to awaken Men to a ſenſe of God's Overruling Providence and Juſtice,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:93273:85"/>
or of the ill Conſequences that attend Vice when it grows Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant: and have no other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign but meerly to gratifie that Itching deſire Men have to be pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the ſecrets of Futurity: which is a piece of Knowledge that of it ſelf will do Men more harm than good, and which God upon that account Conceals for the moſt part from Men, or if he Reveals it, yet he does it by dark and Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Hints on purpoſe: the reaſons of which we ſhall diſcourſe of more at large in the next Chapter. Now as God made the promoting of Vertue and Holineſs the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal deſign of his ſending the Prophets; with reſpect to thoſe particular perſons to whom he ſent them: ſo we find accordingly, that they beſtowed their pains and labour chiefly upon this Subject, to perſwade Men to <hi>break off their ſins by Repentance, and to ceaſe to do evil and learn to do well.</hi> Witneſs thoſe Pathetick Diſſwaſives from Sin, and Exhortations to Vertue, which make up far the greater part
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:93273:85"/>
of their Writings: in which they diſcover ſuch a Spirit of Piety and Holineſs, as is far above the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments of the Law, and approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es very near to the perfection of the Goſpel. But of this more by and by.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The ſecond deſign of God's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting the Prophetical Office, was to keep up a ſenſe of God's Providence in Men's minds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Jews were none of the Acu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt or beſt Temper'd people in the World, and perhaps the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Wiſdom and Integrity would have been little enough to make them keep firm to the belief of the True God, the ſole Creator and Governour of all things, when the whole World beſide was given up to Idolatry. For as ſtrong and prevalent as Truth is, yet 'tis in danger of being overpower'd by Multitude; nay, Singularity makes Truth it ſelf look Suſpicious, and Men are apt to think 'tis more like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Few ſhould be miſtaken than a great Many. Upon this account 'twas neceſſary, that God ſhould
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:93273:86"/>
ſometimes Reinforce the Doctrine of his Univerſal Providence and Government upon the minds of the Jews, by an Extraordinary Method: and by laying open the ſecrets of his Providence, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them firſt what ſhould befall themſelves, if they did not repent, and then their Neighbours; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them that he was the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Lord and Governour of the World, and the Kingdoms of it were at his diſpoſal. 'Tis further to be conſider'd, that when the Jews ſaw how much greater and more flouriſhing the Neighbouring King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> and <hi>Egypt</hi> were, than their own, this was a likely Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to make an Impreſſion upon them, that judg'd of God's <hi>Love or Hatred by what they ſaw be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them;</hi> this might make them imagine, that ſome other Being had a great ſhare in managing Affairs below beſide their God, and tempt them to conclude, that ſince the God whom they Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped was not ſo kind to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, as the Heathen God's were
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:93273:86"/>
to their Votaries, either he was not ſo able, or not ſo willing to reward his Worſhippers, as the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of their Neighbouring Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries were. And 'tis probable that in the Latter times of the Jewiſh Kingdom, when their Enemies made frequent Incurſions into their Country, and threatned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to ſubdue it, and at length did ſo, 'twas a temptation to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Jews to forſake the True God, and turn to Idols, becauſe they ſaw 'twas better with their Worſhippers than with thoſe of True God<note n="e" place="margin">ſee Jer. 44.17, 18.</note>. For theſe reaſons 'twas fit that God ſhould often give this Dull and Unthinking people freſh Aſſurances that all things were at his diſpoſal, that 'twas in his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to make them Happy or Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and that they muſt expect to be one or t'other, according as they obſerv'd or neglected his Commands. And tho it might be ſufficient for this deſign, to have given them the Predictions of ſuch things only as were to come to paſs in their own times; yet God
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:93273:87"/>
was pleas'd to diſcover to his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets what ſhould come to paſs in the <hi>Latter days:</hi> both to honour them with the proſpect of that glorious Scene of things, which he had reſerv'd till <hi>the Fulneſs of time ſhould come,</hi> and give them a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſte of the Joys they were to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect in the <hi>Meſſias</hi>'s Heavenly king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, by diſcovering to them ſome part of the Happineſs of his Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one: and likewiſe to give a convincing Proof to all Ages, that he was the <hi>Firſt and the Laſt,</hi> the ſole Orderer and Diſpoſer of all things, that when the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſhould come to paſs, men might ſay, <hi>This hath God done, and might perceive that 'tis his work.</hi> And this leads me to conſider the</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The third thing which God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in the Inſtitution of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical Office, which was to foretell the times of the Meſſias, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare men's minds for the Reception of him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed to give men notice of theſe things, was God's prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal deſign in ſending the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:93273:87"/>
and the coming of the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias</hi> was what <hi>God ſpake by the mouth of his holy Prophets ever ſince the world began.</hi> And ſince God ſeems to have made this the principal part of the Prophetical Office, I ſhall conſider it as carefully as I can, and ſhall inquire,
<list>
                  <item>1. Firſt, <hi>For what Reaſons God thought fit to reveal this ſo often and ſo particularly.</hi>
                  </item>

               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. As to the firſt, we may aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign two reaſons why God reveal'd this ſo often and ſo particularly.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>To ſhew that this was the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-piece of his Providence, if I may ſo ſpeak, what he had an eye upon in all his particular diſpenſations to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Jews, and what he deſign'd as the ultimate End and Completion of them all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>To wean the Jews by degrees from the Carnal Inſtitutions of the Law, and by diſcovering to them a Better State than that they were under, to raiſe their minds to Spiritual and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:93273:88"/>
things, and thereby prepare them for the reception of the Meſſias.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. As for the firſt of theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; it ſeems as if God deſign'd to raiſe mens Expectations, and make them look upon this as the great Maſter-piece of his Power and Wiſdom, when he made the coming of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Theme of all the Prophets, <hi>Myſtically</hi> impli'd it in all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and <hi>Typically</hi> repreſented it not only in the Ceremonies of the Law, but alſo in the Lives and Actions of the Eminent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons among the Jews in all Ages. What God himſelf lays ſo much Streſs upon, men ought to regard as ſomething more than an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary work of Providence: and ſurely the Prophets had Great and Noble Ideas of it, ſince they ſeem to Vye with each other, who ſhall excel the reſt in ſetting forth its Glories to the beſt Advantage, and by the moſt Emphatical and Lively Repreſentations, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the Capacity of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to whom they were to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh

thoſe glad Tidings. If the <hi>Meſſias</hi> had come into the World without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Notice given of it before hand, the Unexpectedneſs of it would indeed have caus'd Surprize and Wonder, but it would not have been look'd upon as an effect of the <hi>determinate Counſel and Foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God,</hi> and of that <gap reason="foreign">

            <p n="2">2. The ſecond Reaſon I aſſign'd why the coming of the Meſſias did bear ſo great a part in the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Predictions, was <hi>to wean the Jews by degrees from the Legal Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and Inſtitutions: and by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering to them a Better Covenant than that they were under, to raiſe their Minds to Spiritual and Heavenly things, and thereby prepare them for the Reception of the Meſſias.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I look upon it as a certain Truth, that God inſtituted a great
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:93273:89"/>
part of the Ceremonial Law with reſpect to the Opinions that were generally receiv'd at the time when it was enacted, and in complyance with the Rites that the Nations of the World uſed in the Worſhip of their Gods<note n="g" place="margin">v. <hi>Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monid.</hi> More Nevoch. Par. 3. c. 32. p. 432.</note>: that ſo by this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion, he might check that hankering after the Religious Rites of the Nations round about them, which the Jews upon all occaſions diſcover'd to be in their Temper. 'Tis upon this account, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls the Ceremonial Law the <hi>Elements of the world</hi>
               <note n="h" place="margin">Gal. 4.3.</note>, and <hi>weak and beggerly Elements</hi>
               <note n="i" place="margin">Ib. v. 9.</note>. But 'tis true withal, that God in his Wiſdom ſo contrived it, that theſe Rudiments which were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the Rites and Uſages of the Heathen world, were to the Jews the Rudiments or firſt Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of Chriſtianity, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to what the ſame Apoſtle ſays, that <hi>the Law was our Schoolmaſter to bring us unto Chriſt</hi>
               <note n="k" place="margin">Gal. 3.24.</note>. It was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed like the firſt Rudiments of Learning, which young Beginners at firſt do not know the uſe of,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:93273:89"/>
but when they are gone on a pretty way, then they find thoſe Beginnings made the way eaſier for that which comes after. And in like manner, tho the Jews un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood not at firſt God's Deſign in preſcribing ſo many ſeveral kinds of Expiation for ſin, yet when the <hi>way to the Holieſt by the Blood of Chriſt</hi> was laid open, then they might eaſily diſcover, that all thoſe different Rites were deſign'd to repreſent that one Sacrifice of the <hi>Lamb of God</hi> which was offer'd for the Sins of the World. And as God thus complied with the Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of the Jews in that ſtate of Non-age, and fed them like Children, <hi>with milk and not with meat,</hi> with ſuch Inſtructions as were ſuitable to their Capacities: ſo he reveal'd this Great and Ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate End of the Law, by gentle and eaſie degrees, as they were able to Bear it. He firſt diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it faintly under the ſhadows of the Law, which ſeem'd by their own Weakneſs and Imperfection to aim at ſomething more perfect
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:93273:90"/>
than themſelves. But then by the Prophets God manifeſted this grand Intention of his more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: by them he gave large and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Predictions of a New and Better State of things to come, of a <hi>New Covenant, eſtabliſh'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Better Promiſes,</hi> and conſiſting of more Excellent Precepts<note n="l" place="margin">Jer. 31.31.</note>: that God's Kingdom ſhould be inlarg'd, and <hi>all Nations ſhould flow unto it</hi>
               <note n="m" place="margin">Iſ. 2.2.</note>: than <hi>he would take Prieſts and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites out of other Nations</hi>

               <hi>every place Incenſe ſhould be offer'd to him and a pure Offering.</hi> And in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to prepare men's minds for this New State, the Prophets often ſpeak after a ſlighting manner of the Levitical Rites and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies<note n="p" place="margin">Iſ. 1.11. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> -66.3. Jer. 7.22, 23. Hoſ. 6.6. Amos 5.21-24.

Which is ſuch a pitch of Perfection in obedience, as <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law ſeldom recommends: for indeed that was chiefly deſign'd to be a Political
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:93273:90"/>
Law, inſtituted for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Jewiſh Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and therefore as all Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Laws are, 'tis more careful to reſtrain Men from the <hi>Overt-Acts</hi> of Sin, than to make them ſincer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Inwardly Good. In which reſpect St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays<note n="r" place="margin">1 Tim. 1.9.</note> 
               <hi>that the Law was not made</hi> for a Rule <hi>to the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,</hi> but for a Reſtraint to the <hi>Lawleſs and Diſobedient.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Prophets by refining up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Law, and exhorting Men to <hi>fulfil the Righteouſneſs of the Law, by walking not after the Fleſh but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Spirit,</hi> did contribute very much toward the preparing Men's minds for the times of the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias<note n="ſ" place="margin">Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae omnes Egregii ad Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelium Duces. <hi>Grot. in Jer. 7.9.</hi>
               </note>, as they wean'd them from the overfondneſs they had to the Levitical Rites, by ſhewing them a more excellent way to pleaſe God: and as they gave them to underſtand, that God did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign the Moſaical Covenant to be Perpetual, but that that it ſhould at laſt give way to a Better. And theſe diſcourſes which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets made to the Jews, together
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:93273:91"/>
with the ſeveral Afflictions God brought upon them, both in the Captivity and afterward, on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to take off their minds from the Temporal Promiſes, and make them look up to Spiritual and Heavenly Ones, had ſo great an effect upon the generality of that People, that in the latter times we find their Writers diſcourſe of the Nature of Religion in a ſtyle much more agreeable to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Goſpel, than they uſed formerly, as appears by the <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Eccleſiaſticus:</hi> and ſpeak of a Future State with much greater Clearneſs and Aſſurance, as may be ſeen in the Dying Speeches of the <hi>Maccabees</hi>
               <note n="t" place="margin">2 Macc. 7.</note>, and in ſeveral other parts of the <hi>Apocryphal</hi> Writings<note n="u" place="margin">Wiſd. 3. &amp;c. 5. Tob. 3.6.</note>. And all this contributed very much to raiſe in the minds of the Jews that Expectation of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> which we find the generality of them had at the time of our Saviour's Coming<note n="w" place="margin">John 1.20, 21.-7.40, 41. Luke 2.38.-3.15.</note>. I proceed to conſider</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The manner how the Prophets de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd this Prophecy,</hi> and that was Twofold,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:93273:91"/>1. <hi>There were ſome Prophecies which in the Proper, Literal and Primary meaning related to Chriſt, and can't in any Tolerable Senſe be applied to any other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Others, tho in their Literal and Direct ſenſe, they foretold ſome other Event which was nearer at hand, yet had a further and Myſtical ſenſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in them, which related to Chriſt and his Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Concerning the Firſt ſort, I need not ſay much, for they are but few in Compariſon with thoſe of the Second, but are withal ſo plain, that all the Art of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries of Chriſtianity has not been able to avoid the force of them, or wreſt them to any other ſenſe, but what the Chriſtians give of them. <hi>Origen</hi> is very copious upon this Subject<note n="x" place="margin">v. Celſ. l. 1. p. 39, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note>, and proves at large that ſeveral Texts of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, never were fulfill'd in any perſon but our Saviour. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances he gives are <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.10. <hi>Mich.</hi> 5.2. <hi>Iſaiah c.</hi> 52. and 53. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 45. To which we may add, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.24, <hi>&amp;c. Pſalm</hi> 110. <hi>Pſalm</hi>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:93273:92"/>
22.16, 18.—69.21. The greateſt difficulties concern the Second ſort of Prophecies, which have a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſenſe, Literal and Myſtical, for the explaining of which I ſhall lay down theſe following Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That moſt of the Prophecies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Chriſt have a double ſenſe, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral and Myſtical.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That thoſe Prophecies concerning Chriſt, which do Directly point at ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which happen'd before the time of our Saviour, yet have ſome evident Marks in them, which ſhew that they have ſome Further meaning than that which was firſt intended.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>That there are ſeveral very good Reaſons upon which this Opinion of a Double ſenſe in the Prophets, Literal and Myſtical is grounded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The Firſt Obſervation I lay down is, <hi>That moſt of the Prophecies concerning Chriſt have a Double ſenſe, Literal and Myſtical.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to avoid all Cavilling about words, I ſhall firſt premiſe that by the Literal ſenſe, I mean that which the Prophet more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:93273:92"/>
intended, and which pointed at ſome Event that was nearer the Prophets own time, than the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Completion was: and by the Myſtical ſenſe I underſtand, that which had a reſpect to the times of the Goſpel, tho ſometimes this Latter ſenſe is more properly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd by the words, and more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to their Natural Import than the former, as we ſhall ſee preſently. Having premiſed this, I proceed to ſhew that <hi>there is a Literal as well a Myſtical ſenſe in moſt of the Prophecies relating to Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Without allowing this we ſhall make great Confuſion and Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the Prophetical Writings, if we ſuppoſe them to break off Abruptly from the matter in hand, and without any viſible Tranſition go to a quite different Subject. And this is, to ſpeak more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, very unreaſonable to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> who as he is moſt eminent for the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Prophecies concerning the Meſſias, ſo he is as remarkable
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:93273:93"/>
for the Regular Order and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture of his Prophecies, and their Coherence one with another. And the Hiſtorical Relations which he interſperſes in his Writings<note n="y" place="margin">Chap. 7. c. 36-37.-39.</note>, ſerve as a Key to open the Primary and Literal Intention of his whole Prophecy. But the Beauty of it taken all together, will be quite ſpoil'd, except we ſuppoſe him in moſt Caſes to have ſome regard to the Subject he is upon, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to take Hints from thence to diſcourſe concerning the ſtate of the Goſpel, than to fly out into a Forreign Subject without any Reſpect to Order or Coherence. The wonderful Reſtauration of the Jewiſh Nation and Deliverance out of their Captivity, gave a very fit occaſion to the Prophet to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell at the ſame time, that Great Salvation which Chriſt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh, and was a proper Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of our Saviour's giving <hi>Light to the Gentiles who ſat in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and</hi>
               <note n="z" place="margin">Iſaiah 61.1.</note> 
               <hi>proclaiming liberty to the Captives</hi> of Sin and Satan. And
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:93273:93"/>
accordingly the Prophet purſues this with a pompous Eloquence from the 40th. <hi>Chapter,</hi> almoſt to the end of his Prophecy. But yet there's no reaſon to think, that he was ſo intent upon this Latter Subject, as quite to forget the Former: for he was not only an Evangelical Prophet, but likewiſe knew how to <hi>ſpeak a word in ſeaſon to him that was weary</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">Iſaiah 50.4.</note> under op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion and exile, and <hi>preach de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance to the Captives</hi> of Iſrael. But I ſhall give a more evident Inſtance of this, in that Famous Prophecy of his,<note n="b" place="margin">Iſaiah 7.14.</note> 
               <hi>Behold a Virgin ſhall conceive, &amp;c.</hi> It appears by the beginning of the Chapter, that the occaſion of this Prophecy was <hi>Ahaz's</hi> fear of the Kings of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and his diſtruſt of God's delivering him out of that diſtreſs. Upon which the Prophet gives the King his choice of <hi>asking any ſign</hi> of God<note n="c" place="margin">Ibid ver. 11.</note> as a pledge of his Deliverance: and upon his refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to name any, which he did rather out of Deſpair<note n="d" place="margin">ver. 13.</note>, than a modeſt Unwillingneſs to preſcribe
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:93273:94"/>
to God; the Prophet by God's order gives him this Sign, <hi>A virgin ſhall conceive, &amp;c.</hi> Now 'tis plain both by the Occaſion and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of God's giving this Sign, that the words muſt in their primary and Immediate ſenſe, relate to ſomething which ſhould come to paſs very Shortly, or elſe how could it be an aſſurance to <hi>Ahaz</hi> of a ſpeedy Deliverance? For I pray, what ſenſe would there be in ſuch words as theſe, <q>I aſſure you of a ſpeedy Deliverance, by the ſame Token that above 700. years hence the Meſſias ſhall be born of a Virgin?</q> The uſe of a Sign is to go before the thing ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, not to come after it, at leaſt not to keep ſuch a diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind it. Whereas if we ſuppoſe the Firſt intended ſenſe of this Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to be this, <q>that before one who is now a Virgin can bear a Son, and that child come to ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Underſtanding, and know <hi>how to refuſe the evil and chooſe the good</hi>
                  <note n="e" place="margin">Ib. v. 16.</note>,</q> God will deliver <hi>Ahaz:</hi> the intent and meaning of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:93273:94"/>
perfectly anſwers the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it, and exactly agrees with the ſcope of the Context from the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
               <hi>verſe</hi> of this, to the latter end of the <hi>next Chapter.</hi> This Prophecy I thought fit to treat of at large, becauſe it makes out the Double ſenſe of Prophecies which I contend for ſo clearly: for there are as evident Marks of its being intended further than its Primary ſenſe and deſign, as there are of the Primary ſenſe it ſelf, as I ſhall ſhew by and by.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only juſt mention two or three Prophecies more, which plainly and at firſt ſight, imply a Literal ſenſe diſtinct from the Myſtical. The firſt ſhall be that of <hi>Hoſea,</hi>
               <note n="f" place="margin">Hoſ. 11.1.</note> 
               <hi>Out of Egypt have I call'd my Son,</hi> which was certainly firſt meant of God's delivering the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> out of the <hi>Egyptian</hi>
               <note n="g" place="margin">See Exod. 4.22, 23.</note> Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage. Another inſtance is that of <hi>Jeremy,</hi>
               <note n="h" place="margin">Jer 31 15.</note> 
               <hi>In Ramah was there a voice heard, Rachel weeping for her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, &amp;c.</hi> which without queſtion was firſt ſpoken of the Captivity of <hi>Benjamin</hi> by <hi>Nebuchadnezer.</hi> The
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:93273:95"/>
laſt I ſhall mention is that of the Pſalmiſt,<note n="i" place="margin">Pſal. 41.9.</note> 
               <hi>He that eats of my bread hath magnified himſelf againſt me,</hi> which was originally ſpoken by <hi>David</hi> concerning ſome of his own ſervants, who combin'd againſt him in <hi>Abſalom</hi>'s Conſpiracy. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others of the ſame nature might be alledg'd<note n="k" place="margin">2 Sam. 7.14. Pſal. 72.-129.</note>.</p>
            <p n="2">2. My ſecond Obſervation is, <hi>That the Prophecies which have a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral ſenſe beſide the Myſtical, yet have evident Marks that ſomething further is deſign'd by them than what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in the Literal ſenſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tho we allow that many of thoſe Prophecies which the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the New Teſtament quote as irrefragable Proofs of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, pointed Directly and Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately at ſome thing that came to paſs before: yet if we examine them throughly, we ſhall find that generally ſpeaking, the Primary and Literal ſenſe does not come up to the full Force and Import of the Words, but that they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply much more than can be true of the things or perſons which
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:93273:95"/>
were firſt intended: from whence we may conclude that they have a Regard to ſomething further, in which they are properly Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and Fulfill'd. As to inſtance in the Prophecy before mention'd, <hi>Behold a Virgin ſhall conceive and bear a Son:</hi> who does not ſee that the firſt Senſe and Completion, viz. <hi>One that is now a Virgin ſhall marry and bear a Son,</hi> comes infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely ſhort of the full Force and true Meaning of the words? and therefore they certainly look fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than their firſt intended Senſe. So there are ſeveral Prophecies in which ſome of the moſt Remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable Paſſages were never fulfill'd in the Perſons of thoſe concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whom they were firſt ſpoken: as thoſe Paſſages in <hi>David</hi>'s Pſalms,<note n="l" place="margin">Pſal. 22.18, 19.</note> 
               <hi>They pierced my hands and my feet, they parted my garments, and caſt lots upon my veſture.</hi>
               <note n="m" place="margin">Iſ. 69.21.</note> 
               <hi>They gave me gall to eat, and vineger to drink,</hi> were never, that we can find, literally true of <hi>David,</hi> tho 'tis likely Both thoſe Pſalms were at firſt pen'd by him with regard to his own Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances.
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:93273:96"/>
In ſhort, let any man compare the Literal Senſe of the Prophecies relating to Chriſt, as 'tis Explain'd by <hi>Grotius,</hi> (who has took more pains to Clear this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than any other Expoſitor) with the Myſtical, and he will find that generally ſpeaking, the Primary or Literal Senſe does not come up to the full Import and Meaning of the Words: but looks Narrow and Forc'd in many places, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of the Myſtical. From whence 'twill appear that the Prophecies which are applied by the Apoſtles to Chriſt and the Goſpel, are not wreſted from their Natural Senſe, nor applied only by way of <hi>Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation,</hi> (as ſome men love to ſpeak, and Mr. <hi>N.</hi>
               <note n="n" place="margin">Fr. p. 227. Eng. p. 22, 23.</note> ſeems to be of the ſame mind) juſt as men apply the Sentences of an Author to quite different purpoſes from what he at firſt intended by it, and as <hi>Homer</hi>'s and <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Verſes have been made uſe of to expreſs ſuch things as never came into their thoughts.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:93273:96"/>3. The third Obſervation I lay down is, <hi>That there are ſeveral good Reaſons upon which this Opinion of a Literal and Myſtical Senſe in Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies is grounded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>To ſuppoſe a Double Senſe in the Prophetical Writings, is to ſuppoſe them writ in a ſtyle agreeable to that of the Law, and ſuitable to the Rude and Carnal apprehenſions of Religion which prevailed among the Jews.</hi> They always lookt upon the Law as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining ſomething Myſterious and Divine, under the Obvious and common Senſe of it. This the Pſalmiſt acknowledg'd, when he pray'd that God would <hi>Open his eyes, that he might behold wondrous things out of his Law</hi>

And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, who, as has been obſerved already<note n="t" place="margin">P. 140.</note>, adapted the Moſaical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions to the Opinions and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms already receiv'd in the world, thought fit ſo to contrive the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial part of the Law, that the more remarkable Rites and Uſages of it ſhould be a ſhadow of Spiritual and Heavenly things: and by this means ſuited it both to the Greateſt and Meaneſt Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities; retaining the latter in a ſenſe of their Duty, by the Gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs and External Pomp of his Service, which ſtruck and affected their Senſes; and imploying the Inquiſitive in the ſearch of thoſe Spiritual and Heavenly things, which were wrapt up in Figures and Shadows, and were the <hi>Wiſdom of God hid in a Myſtery.</hi> And as the Diligence of Induſtrious perſons, and thoſe who were Lovers of Truth, was ſufficiently rewarded with the finding out of theſe <hi>Deep things</hi> of God which were hid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Vail, ſo the Slothfulneſs of
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:93273:97"/>
Carnal and Worldly Men and their Contempt of Divine Truths, was puniſh'd by leaving them in Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, with the Veil ſtill drawn over the Rites and Inſtitutions of the Law, ſo that they could not look to the Ultimate End and Deſign of it. Which is the very Reaſon our Saviour gives, why he ſpake to the multitude in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.11, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where he tells his Diſciples, that they who would not be at any pains in the ſearch of the Truth, when it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns their Souls, do not deſerve to know it: whereas the Diſciples that were careful Hearers of what Chriſt ſaid unto them, were Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded with the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of the <hi>Myſteries of the Kingdom</hi> of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p>But to return: Since the Law had its double Meaning and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, 'twas reaſonable that the Prophets ſhould have ſo too. The Jews having been uſed to this way of Inſtruction would expect it: the Reaſons why God uſed it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, were the ſame ſtill; for the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:93273:98"/>
Jewiſh Nation, to whom the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets were ſent, was the ſame Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally minded people they ever were, their Thoughts were not much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with any thing but Temporal Bleſſings, and therefore 'twas neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſet forth the Glories of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi>'s Kingdom, by the ſplendid Repreſentations of Worldly Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur, which being a Happineſs that they underſtood and valued, might ſerve to raiſe in their dull and earthly Minds, ſome Deſire and Expectation of his Coming. Whereas if the nature of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom had been ſet forth plainly as it was in it ſelf, the Spiritual Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of it were too Refin'd for them to underſtand, they would have been <hi>far above out of their ſight,</hi> and if they had ſeen ſome Glimpſe of them, yet they would have diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd no <hi>Beauty in them that they ſhould deſire them.</hi> 'Tis for this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the Prophets ſet forth the State of the Goſpel, by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of ſuch things as were in Uſe among the Jews, and were moſt Glorious and Excellent

<pb n="161" facs="tcp:93273:99"/>
to the times of the New, are to be found in the Apoſtolical Writings. Which kind of Interpretations are not ſo Precarious as ſome are apt to imagine, ſince beſides that the Divine Aſſiſtance did certainly accompany theſe Expoſitors, and that this way of Interpreting Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture was allowed by the Jews, for whoſe uſe the Writings of the Apoſtles were immediately and principally deſign'd: I ſay beſides theſe Conſiderations, the Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions themſelves of this kind may be reduced to Fixt Rules and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, the chief of which are theſe two: the Firſt, that which I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd juſt now out of St. <hi>Paul</hi>
               <note n="g" place="margin">1 Cor. 10.11.</note>: the Second is this, viz. <hi>Whatever Priviledges belong'd to the Jews as the</hi> Segullah <hi>or Peculiar People of God, do in a more Eminent manner belong to the Chriſtian Church, which is the Myſtical</hi> Iſrael<note n="h" place="margin">See 1 Pet. 2.9. compar. with Exod. 19.5.6. and Deut. 7.6. 1 Cor. 9.13.14.</note>. Which Rules if Men would have a regard to, and take Directions from the Myſtical Interpretations of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which are to be found in the Writings of the Apoſtles,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:93273:100"/>
'twould keep them from indulging their Fancies too much in theſe Expoſitions, and thereby making the Senſe of Scripture Precarious, which are the uſual Objections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this way of Expounding it, and to which many Men's Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this kind are liable.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>A third Reaſon why the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies ſhould have a Myſtical Senſe as well as a Literal, may be taken from the Nature and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Prophecy in general, which makes it requiſite that Prophecies ſhould be deliver'd with ſome degree of Obſcurity:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Involving a Myſtical ſenſe within a Literal One, is a proper Style for a Prophetical Writing, where the matters ſpoken of ought not to be expreſs'd in too plain words. I deny not but there are ſome plain Prophecies in Scripture, but as much the greater part of them have ſomething of Obſcurity, ſo I doubt not but to make it appear, that the Obſcurity of the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies is ſo far from being an Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction againſt them, as ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that on the contrary, 'tis
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:93273:100"/>
abſolutely requiſite that moſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies ſhould be Obſcure, or elſe they would not anſwer the Deſigns for which they were given, nor be Accompliſh'd in a way agreeable to the Methods of Providence. But of this in the next Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>The Sum of what I have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto ſaid concerning the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Prophetical Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings is this; That if we conſider the Prophets only as men, that were the Teachers of Vertue and Religion, the leaſt that can be ſaid of them is, That in reſpect of their great Improvements in the ſeveral parts of Knowledge, the Excellency of their Precepts, the Integrity of their Lives, their Contempt of the World, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Adhering to their Principles, they were equal to the greateſt <hi>Philoſophers:</hi> but if we conſider them as Inlightned from above, and the Meſſengers of God to the world, they diſcover to us the Various Methods of the Divine Government, they unravel the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:93273:101"/>
Turnings and Windings of that Dark Labyrinth, they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play the Scene of Providence, from the Beginning of this World to the End, and then give us a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Another to come: the Signal Accompliſhment of their Predictions already fulfilled, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms our Belief in Providence, and incourages us to truſt in God, and in the Words of his Prophets for the Future. They do not open the Scene of things to come, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to gratify a Vain Curioſity, or with a Deſign to incourage the Belief of a Fatal Neceſſity, but to aſſure us that God intereſts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the Government of the World, that all things are Guided by his Unerring Hand, and that the Changes which come to paſs in the World, are not the Effects of Blind Chance or Surly Fate, but the Reſults of Infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Goodneſs, which is able to bring Good out of Evil, and make the Rage and <hi>Fierceneſs,</hi> the Folly and Madneſs of man <hi>turn to God's Praiſe,</hi> and be Inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:93273:101"/>
in bringing about his Great Purpoſes and Deſigns. Thus the Holy Prophets teach us to depend upon God, and acknowledge that <hi>our Sufficiency is of him,</hi> and yet withal to believe that 'tis in our own Power in a great meaſure, whether we will be Happy or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable. Thus their Doctrine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motes God's Honour, without ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeding men's Diligence and Indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, and inſtructs us to give him the Glory when we do well, and not to <hi>charge him fooliſhly,</hi> when we do amiſs.</p>
            <p>And as to their way of Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which includes a Hidden and Myſterious Senſe under a Literal and Obvious one, this was agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Method of Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the great Sages of the world practis'd in thoſe early Ages: 'twas what the Jews had been accuſtom'd to, what they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways believ'd to be the Style of Scripture, and do ſo ſtill, tho it make againſt them; it tends to diſcover the Chain of Providence, and the Dependance which by
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:93273:102"/>
the Appointment of the Divine Wiſdom, the Occurrences of one Age have upon thoſe of another which is at a great diſtance. The Prophets themſelves have in moſt Caſes, left us Certain Marks to know where we are to ſeek for Myſteries, and a Key to unlock their true Meaning: and where ſuch an Indication is wanting, we have the Apoſtles to direct us, who have given abundant Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of their Divine Credentials, that they were appointed by God to be the Interpreters of his Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and Publiſhers of his Will.</p>

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:93273:103"/>
of, been throughly Explain'd by any Writer: the Firſt is, <hi>The Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity of the Prophetical Writings,</hi> the other, <hi>Concerning the Marks and Signs whereby True Prophets were diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd from Falſe.</hi> The latter of theſe Inquiries is Embaraſs'd with Great Difficulties, for the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture gives us very little Light in this matter, inſomuch that one would wonder, ſince there are ſo many Conteſts between the True and Falſe Prophets related in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and ſo many Cautions gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven againſt hearkening to Falſe Prophets and Seducers, that there ſhould be ſo little ſaid concerning the Marks whereby they might be diſtinguiſh'd from the True ones.</p>
            <p n="1">I. I begin with the former Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, viz. <hi>The Obſcurity of the Prophecies.</hi> But here I ſhall firſt Premiſe that Obſcurity is not In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable from Prophecy, for there are ſome very plain Prophecies in Scripture: as the Foretelling the 70. <hi>years Captivity of the Jews,</hi> and that <hi>Cyrus,</hi> after that time was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:93273:103"/>
ſhould <hi>Reſtore them to their Land and Rebuild Jeruſalem</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">Jer. 25.11, 12.-29.10. Iſ. 44.28.</note>, the <hi>Succeſſion of the Monarchies</hi> in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">Dan. 2. c. 7. c. 8.</note>, and thoſe Prophecies concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Meſſias, which foretell his Coming, while the <hi>Second Temple was ſtanding, and before the Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Jewiſh Commonwealth</hi>
               <note n="d" place="margin">Dan. 9.25, &amp;c. Hagg. 2. 6.-9. Malac. 3.1.-4.1.</note>. But notwithſtanding ſome few Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, generally ſpeaking, there is ſomething of Obſcurity in the Delivery of Prophecies. Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the Cauſes of this which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe from the Prophetical Style, which is full of Metaphors, and of lofty Expreſſions, ſuch as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally flow from a Heat of Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, where Great and Surprizing Ideas have made a deep Impreſſion, beſides this there are other Reaſons to be aſſign'd for this Obſcurity, which are taken from the very Nature and Deſign of Prophecies, and the manner how they are Fulfilled.</p>
            <p n="1">1. With Reſpect to the firſt of theſe, viz. the Deſign of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, I lay down this Rule,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:93273:104"/>
               <hi>That Prophecies are not ſo much deſign'd by God to give men the Knowledge of things before-hand, as to confirm mens Faith after they are come to paſs, and convince them that this was God's Work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I willingly grant, that God did Reveal things to come to his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, both to do them a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Honour<note n="e" place="margin">Gen. 18.17.</note>, by making them Privy to his ſecret Counſels and Deſigns, and likewiſe to prepare and fit men for the Bleſſings fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, of which I have diſcours'd in the laſt Chapter<note n="f" place="margin">P. 139. &amp;c.</note>: but yet I think the Uſe of Prophecies chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſiſts in the Comparing the Event with the Prophecy, which when they are found perfectly to agree, 'tis a great Evidence of God's Providence in General, and that this particular Event which the Prophecy relates to, was an Effect of his Overruling Power. There are ſeveral paſſages in the Prophets that plainly ſhew, this was the Intent of many of their Prophecies. God himſelf gives this Reaſon why he foretold the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:93273:104"/>
of the Jewiſh Captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty<note n="f" place="margin">Iſ. 48.5.</note>, <hi>I have even from the beginning declar'd it to thee, before it came to paſs I ſhewed it thee, leſt thou ſhouldeſt ſay, My Idol hath done them, and my Graven Image, and my Mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Image hath commanded them.</hi> And ſuch Events as the Jews were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to aſcribe to their Idols, if God had not prevented it, many others would willingly aſcribe to Fate or Chance, and not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the hand of God in them. And therefore God to vindicate his Providence, and ſhew that he Intereſts himſelf in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the world, and more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in ſuch Caſes where his Church is concern'd, has been pleas'd to Foretell ſeveral Future Events, that when they came to paſs, men might be convinc'd that they were the <hi>Lord's doing.</hi> The ſame thing is intimated in thoſe Remarkable Paſſages of <hi>Daniel.</hi>
               <note n="g" place="margin">Dan. 12.4. See ver. 9, 10.</note> 
               <hi>Thou O Daniel, ſhut up the words and ſeal the Book even to the time of the End: Many ſhall run to and fro, and knowledge ſhall be increaſed.</hi> And
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:93273:105"/>
to the ſame purpoſe, c. 8.26. <hi>Shut thou up the Viſion, for yet it ſhall be for many days.</hi> The meaning of which places is, <q>Lay this Prophecy up ſafe till after times, for it can't be underſtood<note n="h" place="margin">See Iſ. 29.11. Rev. 52.</note> as yet; but when the things themſelves are near, and ready to be brought to paſs, then men ſhall begin to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it: the Gradual Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Prophecies ſhall open their Underſtandings, and the comparing thoſe parts of the Prophecy which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready fulfilled with the event, ſhall give light into, and direct Men to Judge of thoſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars which are yet to be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled.</q> We find St. <hi>John</hi>
               <note n="i" place="margin">Rev. 22.10.</note> receives a Command quite contrary to this which was given to <hi>Daniel,</hi> ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the contrary Reaſon, <hi>Seal not the ſayings of the Prophecy of this Book, for the time is at hand.</hi> 'Tis indeed very probable that a great part of the <hi>Revelations</hi> is not yet fulfill'd, and therefore one would think that this Prophecy might have been Order'd to be
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:93273:105"/>
Seal'd up at the firſt Delivery of it as well as <hi>Daniel's</hi> But the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between theſe two Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies ſeems to lie here, that tho ſome parts of the <hi>Revelations</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Latter times of the Church, yet others relate to the Firſt Ages of it, and upon that account 'twas fit that it ſhould not be Sealed up, but laid open to be Read<note n="k" place="margin">Rev. 1.3.</note> and Conſider'd, from the very time when it was deliver'd, becauſe the Accompliſhment of ſome parts of it Commenc'd very early: and therefore the things contain'd in it, are ſaid to be ſuch as <hi>muſt ſhortly come to paſs</hi>
               <note n="l" place="margin">Rev. 1.1.</note>. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as that Prophecy of <hi>Daniel's</hi> which relates to <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> (and I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Command of Sealing up the Book belongs only to that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Prophecy, as will appear by comparing the Context of the two foremention'd paſſages<note n="m" place="margin">Dan. 11.36, &amp;c. to c. 12.5-8 13, to 26.</note> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether) I ſay, the coming of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt</hi> foretold by <hi>Daniel,</hi> was a great way off of <hi>Daniels</hi> own time, and no part of the Prophecy relating to it, ſhortly to be accompliſh'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:93273:106"/>I think from theſe places 'tis evident, that the Uſe of ſeveral Prophecies according to God's own Intention, did chiefly conſiſt in Comparing them with the Event, after they were fulfill'd: and that they were in a manner uſeleſs, as a <hi>Book</hi> that is <hi>Sealed</hi> up, till the things themſelves appear'd. Now if Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies were deſign'd to be Explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Event, this ſuppoſes that the words in which they are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd, are not to be plain of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. But there is another Reaſon why God ſhould not give Men a Clear and Diſtinct Knowledge of what is to come, and that is, becauſe</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The fulfilling of Prophecies, if the things are diſtinctly Revealed, is Inconſiſtent with the Freedom of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Actions, and the Manner how Providence brings the things Foretold to paſs: which is a Second Reaſon why Prophecies ſhould be Obſcure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God always makes uſe of Men to be the Inſtruments of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, but if they certainly knew what was to come to paſs, and how it was to be brought to paſs, they
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:93273:106"/>
could not be Inſtrumental in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to paſs in a Rational and Free way of Acting; becauſe it would not leave them wholly to themſelves, to have a full Power over, and a free Determination of their own Actions. And that whether the thing foreknown be Good or Bad: if it be Good, it tempts Men to Careleſneſs, and to preſume too much upon God's promiſe, for then Men are apt to argue thus, <q>What need we trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble our ſelves with helping to fulfil God's promiſes, as if he were not able to bring about his Deſigns without our Aſſiſtance? God is obliged in Honour to ſee his Words made good, and we need not fear but he will take care that they be perform'd.</q> On the other ſide, if the Prophecy foretell ſome Sinful Action to be committed, ſuch a Prophecy would Humanely ſpeaking, very often deſtroy it ſelf, and the very fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling it plainly, would hinder the thing foretold from coming to paſs. For if ſuch Prophecies were ſo
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:93273:107"/>
plain that every body at firſt ſight could ſee the whole Contrivance, and look thro all the Scenes of the Action, they could not be brought to paſs without offering violence to Men's Voluntary De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations, and making them purely Paſſive in producing the foretold Events, and meer Tools in the Hand of God Almighty. For Inſtance, if our Saviours Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifixion had been foretold with all the particular Circumſtances, the Manner how, and the preciſe Time when it was to be brought to paſs, and the Perſons that were to be concern'd in it, we can't imagine ſo many of the Chief and Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Men among the Jews would have had a Hand in it, without being perfectly carried on to it by an Overruling Power againſt their own Inclinations: which beſides its thwarting the Principles of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, muſt make God the Author of Sin. But ſince the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies concerning the <hi>Meſſias</hi> and his Sufferings, were deliver'd with ſuch a mixture of Obſcurity, as
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:93273:107"/>
never to be fully underſtood till after the Event, this gave Room for the Jews Malice to concur with God's Providence in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this to paſs, and ſo as St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells them,<note n="a" place="margin">Acts 13.27.</note> 
               <hi>Becauſe they knew him not, nor yet the voices of the Prophets, they fulfilled them in condemning him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, as plainly foretelling who are to be Actors in Wickedneſs, would, without ſuppoſing manifeſt Violence offer'd to Men's Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in many Caſes hinder ſome of them from being Inſtrumental in bringing about God's Deſigns, ſo perhaps it would be a new Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation to others, and make them more furiouſly bent upon Evil: juſt as the mentioning wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs ſtirs up ſome Men's Ill In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, and makes them eager to commit it. Eſpecially ſince the foretelling it as certainly to come to paſs, affords a Plea for Men's Wickedneſs: for Men that are bent upon Evil, and are glad of any Colour to juſtify their Sin, will conclude from thence, that it can be no Sin to be ſubſervient to
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:93273:108"/>
God's Providence, and Aſſiſting in the Accompliſhment of his Will and Purpoſe; or if it be a Sin, it muſt lie at his door. So that if Prophecies were too plainly deliver'd, this would often be the conſequence, that the bringing the Event to paſs would be wholly imputed to the Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Prediction: juſt as Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Commotions do often take their Riſe from the ſpreading a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout of Prophecies concerning the Death of the Prince or the Change of the Government. Now this is contrary to God's method of dealing with Men: for tho we cannot comprehend after what manner he foreſees how Free A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents will Determine themſelves, yet we have all the Reaſon in the World to believe, that Gods Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience does not Interfere with mens Free-will. And therefore as we believe that things do not come to paſs meerly becauſe God Foreſees them, but rather that he Foreſees them becauſe their own proper Cauſes will bring them to paſs: ſo 'tis agreeable to the methods of
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:93273:108"/>
Providence, that Prophecies ſhould be ſo worded, as not to have any Influence upon the parties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in bringing them about; that it might not be ſaid, The thing came to paſs becauſe it was Foretold, but it was foretold be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it would come to paſs, as an Ordinary effect of a Natural Cauſe. 'Tis true indeed, we may obſerve that ſome Scripture Prophecies by being too plainly deliver'd, have made the <hi>Hearts of Wicked Men wholly ſet in them,</hi> to bring to paſs <hi>the Evil</hi> foretold<note n="b" place="margin">See 1 King. 11.31, 32. 2 King. 8.12, 13, 15 —10.10.</note>. But perhaps God might do this on purpoſe to take off the minds of the Jews from that greedy deſire they had to ſearch into Futurity, when they ſaw what Ill Conſequences did ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times attend that Knowledge. The Sum of the Argument is this: that the Evil which if Foretold Darkly and Obſcurely, needed nothing to bring it to paſs, but only God's ſuffering Men's Wickedneſs to break out, and permitting them to act according as their Ill Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations prompt them: if it were
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:93273:109"/>
foretold Plainly and Clearly, could not be effected without ſuppoſing him to offer Violence to Humane Nature, and making him a Party concern'd, and a Tempter of men to Wickedneſs.</p>
            <p>From all that has been ſaid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this head it appears, that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the thing foretold be Good or Evil, the foretelling it too Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually and Diſtinctly, would make Prophecy a <hi>Felo de ſe,</hi> and be an effectual way to defeat its Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment, for then it could not be brought to paſs in a way that is ſuitable to the Divine Purity and Wiſdom. For this is one of the Maſter-pieces of the Divine Wiſdom, to bring about its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns in ſuch a manner, as never to put any Force upon the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of man's Will, ſo that the Events may rather ſeem the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Effects of Free Agents, than the Works of an Overruling Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. To this purpoſe ſpeaks the Author of the Book of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom<note n="c" place="margin">Wiſd. 8.1.</note>, <hi>Thy Wiſdom, O Lord, reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from one end to another Mightily,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:93273:109"/>
and Sweetly doth ſhe order all things.</hi> God ſees every Link of that Vaſt Chain of Cauſes, and knows how they depend upon each other: what Force each Circumſtance has in determining mens Reſolutions, and what it is that turns the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of the Mind one way or t'other: and therefore tho he brings to paſs all his Purpoſes in an Irreſiſtable manner, yet he does it withall in ſo Eaſie and Gentle a one, that the Events look like the Reſult of mens own Free Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and one would think that the Natural Agents, let alone to themſelves would have produc'd the ſame Effect.</p>
            <p>Theſe two Reaſons fully juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Obſcurity of Prophecies, and ſhew us the Uſe of them, that we are not to look upon them as deliver'd meerly to gratifie the Curioſity men have to pry into what is Future, but to be an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to us of Gods Overruling Providence, which extends it ſelf to the moſt Minute Actions, and very often makes ſuch Accidents,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:93273:110"/>
as ſeem to us to be Trivial and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificant, Inſtrumental in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to paſs the Greateſt and moſt Surprizing Events: and eſpecially to ſhew us, That nothing befalls his Church but by his determinate Counſel and Foreknowledge.</p>
            <p>I will conclude this Head with a Brief Caution to thoſe, who do not think the Prophecies concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Chriſt and the Goſpel Clear enough to be an Argument for our Belief: and that is this, That they ought not to expect that the Prophecies ſhould give as diſtinct an Account of Chriſt as the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels do, nor becauſe they do not, ſhould they ſlight them as Inſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant: but they ſhould firſt of all conſider the Evidence of Truth, which the Goſpel brings along with it, and then Compare it with the Prophecies. And thus, tho the Prophecies be Obſcure in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, yet when they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd with the Event, as they will receive Light from it, ſo they will add Light to it. Juſt as that Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure Saying of our Saviour's,<note n="d" place="margin">Joh. 2.19.</note> 
               <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:93273:110"/>
this Temple, and in three days I will raiſe it up,</hi> was not underſtood by his Diſciples when he ſpoke it, but afterward when they Compar'd it with the Event which it foretold, it was a new Argument to them that he came forth from God<note n="e" place="margin">Ver. 22.</note>.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Another Difficulty concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Prophecy, the Reſolving of which will tend to Eſtabliſh the Authority of the Prophets, is, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Signs whereby True Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets were diſtinguiſh'd from Falſe ones.</hi> 'Tis plain by the Prophetick Writings, that there were Falſe Prophets that oppos'd themſelves to the True ones, and utter'd quite contrary Prophecies to theirs. But tho the True Prophets warn the People often not to be ſeduc'd by theſe Falſe pretenders, yet we can diſcover but little out of their Writings, concerning the Marks whereby the True Prophets were to be diſtinguiſh'd from the Falſe ones. Thoſe which I can gather from the Holy Writings are theſe following.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>If a Prophet indeavour'd to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the people to Idolatry, this was
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:93273:111"/>
a certain Mark that he was a Falſe Prophet, tho he ſhould confirm what he ſaid by a Sign.</hi> This Rule is laid down by <hi>Moſes</hi>
               <note n="e" place="margin">Deut. 13.1.</note>, and is grounded upon very good reaſon: For ſince God had manifeſted his Power to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> by ſo many Undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Miracles and Proofs, 'twas not reaſonable that working a ſingle Wonder, or foretelling one Event which might come to paſs by meer Chance, ſhould overthrow the Authority of ſo many more and greater Works. For tho God doth ſuffer Impoſtors to work Strange Feats ſometimes for the Trial of his people<note n="f" place="margin">Deut. 13.3. Matth, 24.24.</note>, yet I doubt not but he always takes care that his own Works ſhall viſibly exceed theirs, both in <hi>Power,</hi> in <hi>Gravity,</hi> and in <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſefulneſs:</hi> ſo that their <hi>Tricks</hi> ſhall appear as juſt nothing when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd with his Miracles, as <hi>Aaron's Rod ſwallowed up thoſe of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi>
               <note n="g" place="margin">Exod. 8.12.</note>. Or elſe God would allow too great an Authority to Impoſtors, and make Miracles by themſelves no Evidence of a Divine Miſſion, ſince 'twould be in ſome Caſes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:93273:111"/>
to diſtinguiſh True ones from Counterfeit. And this I take to be a ſatisfactory Anſwer to that Queſtion, <hi>Whether God's permitting Evil Spirits and Seducers to ſhew Signs and Wonders, does not eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuate the Authority of Miracles in general:</hi> tho I grant there are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Marks<note n="h" place="margin">V. <hi>Orig.</hi> c. <hi>Celſ.</hi> l. 1. p. 53. l. 2. p. 90, 91. Ed. Cant. Bp. <hi>Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfl.</hi> Orig. ſacr. l. 2. c. 10.</note> whereby to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh True Miracles from Falſe, which 'tis not my Buſineſs at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to diſcourſe of.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>'Tis reaſonable to think that the Prophets, when they firſt entred upon their Prophetick Office, gave ſome Sign of their Miſſion, either by wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a Miracle, or by revealing ſome Secret, Remote or Future thing, which was not within the Compaſs of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Knowledge, and the Nature of which was ſuch, that a little time would quickly diſcover, whether the Prophet ſpake True or not.</hi> We may find footſteps in Scripture of theſe ſeveral ways being accounted the Marks of a Prophet. We find the <hi>Phariſees demand a ſign from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>
               <note n="i" place="margin">Matth. 16.1. Joh. 6.30. Matth. 12.38.</note> of our Saviour, ſuch as <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua</hi>
               <note n="k" place="margin">Joſ. 10.12.</note>, <hi>Samuel</hi>
               <note n="l" place="margin">1 Sam. 12.18.</note>, <hi>Iſaiah</hi>
               <note n="m" place="margin">Iſ. 38.8.</note>, and <hi>Elias</hi>
               <note n="n" place="margin">2 King. 1.10.</note>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:93273:112"/>
had wrought. And the <hi>Samaritan</hi> Woman judg'd our Saviour to be the Chriſt, becauſe <hi>he told her all things that ever ſhe did</hi>
               <note n="o" place="margin">John 4.29.</note>. This ſhews that in the common Opinion, the Diſcovering of ſome Hidden thing, and out of the ordinary reach of Humane Knowledge, was eſteem'd the Mark of a Prophet: and the <hi>Meſſias</hi> being the Prophet the Jews at that time Expected, the Woman concludes from thence that he who knew ſuch Secrets muſt be the Meſſias. And perhaps for this Reaſon the Jews who lookt upon our Saviour as a Pretender only to Prophecy, demand of him the Diſcovery of a Mock-ſecret<note n="p" place="margin">Matth. 26.68.</note>, viz. <hi>Who it was that ſmote him</hi> when he was Blindfolded.</p>
            <p>It appears from other places, that the Prophets did commonly foretell ſomething which ſhould Shortly come to paſs, and the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of this their Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction did eſtabliſh their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for the Future, and gave Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibility to thoſe Prophecies of theirs, whoſe Accompliſhment
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:93273:112"/>
was at a greater diſtance. So the Man of God that <hi>Propheſied a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the altar of Bethel</hi>
               <note n="q" place="margin">1 Kings 13.1, 2.</note>, beſide his foretelling above 300. years before the Birth of that Prince, that one of <hi>David's</hi> Family <hi>Joſiah</hi> by name, ſhould Defile that Altar; at the ſame time gave another Sign of his Miſſion that was preſently to come to paſs, viz. <hi>that the Altar ſhould be rent, and the Aſhes of it pour'd out</hi>
               <note n="r" place="margin">Ib. v. 3.</note>. The fulfilling of which was an Argument of his Veracity as to the other part of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy; where the Event was at ſuch a Diſtance, that tho it ſhould not Correſpond with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, it could not at preſent be Diſproved, and therefore the bare Foretelling it did not bring along with it ſufficient Evidence that the Prophet who ſpoke it, was really ſent from God. In like manner 'tis ſaid of <hi>Samuel</hi>
               <note n="ſ" place="margin">1 Sam. 3.19, 20. -c. 9.6.</note>, that <hi>all Iſrael knew him to be an Eſtabliſht Prophet of the Lord's,</hi> when they ſaw that <hi>none of his</hi> Prophetick <hi>words fell to the ground.</hi> So <hi>Ezekiel</hi> having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd a Prediction, adds,<note n="t" place="margin">Ezek. 33.33.</note> 
               <hi>When
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:93273:113"/>
this ſhall come to paſs, then they ſhall know that a Prophet has been among them:</hi> as if he had ſaid, <q>However Men may ſlight my Words now, and value them no more than a <hi>Song</hi>
                  <note n="u" place="margin">ver. 32.</note> which Men hearken to only to paſs away the time, yet the fulfilling of what I ſay will eſtabliſh my Authority beyond Contradiction.</q> Which is an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that Men commonly ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended their Judgement concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Authority of a Prophet, till they had Tried his Veracity, by ſeeing whether ſome one Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of his, which he delivered as a Teſt of his Miſſion, came to paſs or no.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Tho Prophets uſually gave a Sign in Teſtimony of their Miſſion, yet Some Prophets did not, who were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be Tried by other Rules.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis Recorded particularly of <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> that he <hi>did no Miracle</hi>
               <note n="x" place="margin">John 10.41.</note>, and yet the <hi>people counted him a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi>
               <note n="y" place="margin">Matth. 21.26.</note>, which they would not have done, if a Prophet had always given a Sign, before he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted ſo: and we ſee that even
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:93273:113"/>
the Prieſts and Elders could not find any thing to Object againſt his Authority<note n="z" place="margin">Ibid ver. 25.</note>. Now in ſuch a Caſe, I ſuppoſe they judged of a Prophet's Pretences by ſome of theſe following Tokens, by the <hi>Holineſs of his Life and Doctrine,</hi> by the <hi>Agreement of what he ſaid with the Predictions or diſcourſes of other Prophets,</hi> and eſpecially if <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Prophet of undoubted Authority bare witneſs to him:</hi> according to that Maxime of the Jewiſh Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters<note n="a" place="margin">
                  <hi>Maimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nid.</hi> Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam. Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis. c. 10. Sect. 9.</note>, <hi>The Prophet, of whom ſome other <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndoubted Prophet witneſſeth that he is a Prophet, is aſſuredly ſuch.</hi> All theſe Marks concurr'd in <hi>John Baptiſt;</hi> his Office was plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd by <hi>Iſaiah</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">Iſ. 40.3.</note>, and both that and his Perſon by <hi>Malachi</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">Mal. 3.1. —4.5.</note>: his Doctrine was Holy, and his Life an exact Copy of what he taught; ſo here was no room to ſuſpect him a Counterfeit, tho he gave no Sign to atteſt his Miſſion.</p>
            <p>We may farther obſerve, that the Prophets of the Old Teſtament inſiſt upon theſe three things, <hi>viz. Purity of Doctrine, Holineſs of Life,</hi>
               <pb n="190" facs="tcp:93273:114"/>
and <hi>Agreement with other Prophets,</hi> as the Tokens whereby they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſht themſelves from the Falſe Prophets. They tell us, there is as plain a difference between the Viſions of True Prophets and the Dreams of Falſe Ones, as <hi>betwixt Chaff and Wheat</hi>
               <note n="d" place="margin">Jer. 23.28.</note>: which muſt be upon this account, that the one ſort tends to diſcourage Sin, and ſet forth the terrible Conſequences of it<note n="e" place="margin">Ibid. ver. 29.</note>, whereas the other deſigns to ſooth Men up in their Vices, by <hi>Healing the Wounds</hi> of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience <hi>Slightly,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Peace, Peace</hi>

Jer. 27.18.</note>. And as to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mark of True Prophets, <hi>viz. their Agreement with other Prophets,</hi> we find <hi>Jeremy</hi> Appealing to it, in the Conteſt between him and <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naniah,</hi> who Propheſied<note n="n" place="margin">Jer. 28 3, 4.</note> of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of <hi>Jechoniah's</hi> Captivity, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what <hi>Jeremy</hi> had foretold. Upon which <hi>Jeremy</hi> tells him<note n="o" place="margin">Ib. ver 8, 9.</note>, <hi>The Prophets that were before me and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee of old, propheſied of War and Evil and Peſtilence, the Prophet that propheſieth of Peace, when the word of the Prophet ſhall come to paſs, then ſhall the Prophet be known that the Lord hath ſent him.</hi> Where <hi>Jeremy</hi> argues againſt the Truth of <hi>Hananiah</hi>'s Prophecy, and proves that what himſelf had propheſied was much more Credible of the two, becauſe many other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets agreed with him in prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſying evil againſt the Jews, and ſeveral other Countries, whereas
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:93273:115"/>
he being ſingle in his Prophecy concerning Peace, nothing but the Punctual Anſwering of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, could give him the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of a Prophet: and people muſt Suſpend their judgments till Time ſhouuld diſcover whether he were in the Right or no. Which place ſeems likewiſe to imply, that <hi>Hananiah</hi> had never before given a Sign to atteſt his Miſſion, and therefore his Credit would juſtly be queſtionable, till men could ſee whether his Sign came to paſs or not.</p>
            <p>From what has been ſaid, we may conclude it probable, that where a Prophet gave no Sign whereby men might make Tryal of the Reality of his Pretenſions, they made a judgment of it by conſidering his Education, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he had been brought up in the <hi>Schools of the Prophets,</hi> which were the Seminaries of Inſpir'd perſons; by examining his Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Life, his Doctrine, and his Agreement with other Prophets: and the more any of theſe was liable to Exceptions, the more
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:93273:115"/>
need was there that he ſhould give a Sign to atteſt his Miſſion. So for Example, 'twas more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite that <hi>Amos</hi> ſhould give a Sign who was no <hi>Prophet</hi> by Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation or <hi>Prophets Son, but a Herd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
               <note n="p" place="margin">Amos 8.14.</note> by Profeſſion, than any of thoſe Prophets who were of the Prieſtly Order, or brought up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Sons of the Prophets.</hi>

            <p>THe Two Preceding Chapters concerning Prophecy being a Digreſſion with reſpect to the Book which I undertook to Anſwer, tho not with Reſpect to the General Deſign of this Treatiſe, which is to <hi>Vindicate the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:93273:116"/>
Authority of the Scriptures:</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to Mr. <hi>N</hi>'s <hi>Memorial,</hi> as 'tis Communicated by the Author of the <hi>Letters,</hi> and ſhall Examine in this Chapter the Exceptions which he makes againſt the Authority of the Old Teſtament Writings. Which are of two ſorts, General and Particular: The General Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions are levell'd againſt the Authority of the <hi>Old Teſtament Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> which this Author ſuppoſes<note n="a" place="margin">Fr. p. 279. En. p 106.</note> to <hi>conſiſt of all the Ancient Writings,</hi> whether Perfect or Imperfect, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Inſpir'd or not, <hi>which were remaining among the Jews at the time when this Collection was made.</hi> The Particular Exceptions relate to Particular Books, which he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes not to be Inſpir'd, either becauſe the matter of them is ſuch as Men may <hi>know and faithfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late without Inſpiration,</hi> ſuch as are the Hiſtorical Books<note n="b" place="margin">Fr. p. 233. En. p. 31.</note>: or elſe becauſe <hi>they contain ſomething in them which is <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nworthy of God being its Author,</hi> which Exception he advances againſt ſeveral Paſſages in the <hi>Pſalms</hi> and the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> and
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:93273:116"/>
againſt the Intire Books of <hi>Job, Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> and the <hi>Song of Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">Fr. p. 271, &amp;c Eng. p. 93, &amp;c.</note>.</p>
            <p>In Anſwer to theſe Twofold Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, I ſhall
<list>
                  <item>I. <hi>Say ſomething concerning the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Inſpiration of the Old-Teſtament Canon in General.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>II. <hi>I ſhall make a Reply to his Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections againſt the Particular Books which are part of this Canon.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. As to the Firſt, it muſt be confeſs'd that we cannot give an Exact Account, by whoſe Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity the Canon of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was ſetled, for we have no Writings extant that give us a Hiſtory of that Affair. But 'tis very probable the Collection of the Canonical Books, was made in <hi>Ezra</hi>'s time, or not long after: 1. Becauſe the Scripture-Hiſtory ends about that time. I know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of later date in it, than the mention of <hi>Jaddus</hi> by <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi>
               <note n="d" place="margin">Neh. 12.10, 22.</note> who was Contemporary with <hi>Ezra,</hi> which <hi>Jaddus</hi> was High
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:93273:117"/>
Prieſt at the Beginning of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> the Great's Reign. And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever others may have objected to the contrary, the mentioning of this <hi>Jaddus,</hi> is very reconcileable with the time when <hi>Nehemiah</hi> writ, as a <hi>Great Prelate</hi> has lately made out with Incomparable Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Clearneſs<note n="e" place="margin">Letter to Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> about a paſſage in <hi>Joſephus,</hi> &amp;c.</note>. 2. Becauſe <hi>Malachi</hi> the Prophet, that lived much about the ſame time, ſeems <hi>to Seal up the Viſion and Prophecy</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Jews, by referring them to the <hi>Law of Moſes</hi> as their ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Inſtructor, till the Goſpel ſhould be revealed: and pointing out to <hi>Elias</hi> the Forerunner of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> as the next great Prophet that was to be reveal'd<note n="f" place="margin">Mal. 4.4, 5.</note>. And indeed his Prophecy looks as if it were deſign'd to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nect the Old and New Teſtament together, by putting a period to the Old Teſtament Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and directing men to the New for further Inſtruction. This Argument will appear more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, if we conſider 3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, That under the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> the Jews
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:93273:117"/>
look'd upon the Gift of Prophecy as wholly ceaſed, and were of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it had been ſo for a conſiderable time<note n="g" place="margin">See 1 Macc. 4.46.-9.27.-14.41.</note>. The ſame Opinion is con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>firm'd not long after by the Author of <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi>
               <note n="h" place="margin">Ecclus. 36.14, 15, 16.</note>. 4. If we ſuppoſe the <hi>LXX. Interpreters</hi> Tranſlated all the Old Teſtament, which is an Opinion that Learned men<note n="i" place="margin">
                  <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legom. 9. in Bibl. Polygl. n. 11. <hi>Vales.</hi> in <hi>Euſ.</hi> H.E. l. 5. c. 8.</note> have brought good Reaſons for, then 'tis plain the Canon muſt have been ſettled before the time when that Verſion was made, which was done under <hi>Ptolomee Philadelphus,</hi> and as 'tis very probable, at the Beginning of his Reign<note n="k" place="margin">
                  <hi>Vales.</hi> ibid.</note>. 5. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever that be, yet 'tis certain that when the Book of <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> was writ, the Canon of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament was ſettled: for he makes mention of the <hi>Twelve Prophets</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together<note n="l" place="margin">Ecclus. 49.10.</note>, which is an Argument that the Smaller Prophets were then Collected, and Compil'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one Book, which Book was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward call'd the <hi>Book of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi>
               <note n="m" place="margin">See Act. 7.42. <hi>Justin M.</hi> c. Tryph. p. 45.50.57. (Ed. <hi>Steph.) Cyprian.</hi> Epiſt. 59. Ed. <hi>Oxon.</hi>
               </note>. Nay further, the Author of the <hi>Prologue</hi> to that Book, ſpeaks of the <hi>Law, Prophets and
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:93273:118"/>
other Books of Scripture,</hi> as then Tranſlated into <hi>Greek,</hi> which is an Undeniable Argument that the Canon was then Completed. And tho we ſuppoſe that <hi>Prologue</hi> to be made by the Grandchild of the principal Author <hi>Jeſus</hi> the ſon of <hi>Syrach,</hi> which Younger <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racides</hi> lived in the time of <hi>Euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getes</hi> II. commonly called <hi>Ptolomee Phyſcon:</hi> yet it appears by the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of that <hi>Prologue,</hi> that his Grandfather ſtudied the ſame Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Books, which he afterwards ſays were turn'd into Greek. And this Elder <hi>Siracides</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>Simon</hi> the ſon of <hi>Onias</hi> the High Prieſt, as one whom he very well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred<note n="n" place="margin">c. 50. 1, &amp;c.</note>: now that <hi>Simon</hi> was High Prieſt in the Beginning of <hi>Philopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi>'s Reign<note n="o" place="margin">See 3 Macc. 2.1. com. with c. 1.1.</note>, who was next in Succeſſion but one to <hi>Philadelphus.</hi> So that the Canon of Scripture will appear to be as old as <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphus</hi>'s time, becauſe 'tis evident from hence that 'twas Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all into <hi>Greek</hi> in a little time after, tho we ſhould not ſuppoſe the whole work performed by the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:93273:118"/>
LXX. Laſtly, to theſe Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations we may add the Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Teſtimony of all the <hi>Ancient Writers,</hi> both Jewiſh and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, who agree in ſuppoſing the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of the Old Teſtament, to have been Compil'd in or about <hi>Ezra</hi>'s time, and who probably had the Authority of ſome Ancient Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters for what they ſay, which now are loſt. And if theſe Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions taken all together, have any Force in them to prove the Canon of the Old Teſtament, to have been ſettled in <hi>Ezra</hi>'s time, or in the next Age; I ſay if it were ſettled ſo early, this very thing will add great Weight to its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
            <p>For 1. 'tis agreed on all hands that <hi>Ezra,</hi> who calls himſelf <hi>a Ready Scribe in the Law of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
               <note n="p" place="margin">Ezr 7.6.</note>, Revis'd the Holy Writings, Retriev'd them from the Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which the Scarcity of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies, and the Diſuſe of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> Language during the Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, had brought into them: ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied and completed many of them,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:93273:119"/>
and put them into Order and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod: And when a man of ſo great Authority as <hi>Ezra</hi> was, had done all this ſo lately, it cannot be imagin'd but that the Compi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of the Canon, muſt have had a particular Regard to his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and admitted no Books in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Collection, but what were allow'd of by <hi>Ezra:</hi> or if they were of Later date than his time, the Writing of them muſt have been within the Memory of theſe Compilers, ſo that they were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Judges, whether a Book de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd to be eſteem'd Sacred or not. So that from hence 'twill fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that the Authority of the main Body of the Canon, bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms upon the Judgment and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of <hi>Ezra:</hi> whom if we ſhould grant to have been no Prophet, yet we canot think, but in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſuch Moment, as the Revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and putting in order the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Writings, he would not only uſe the beſt Skill he had himſelf, but likewiſe conſult with <hi>Haggai, Zechary</hi> or <hi>Malachi;</hi> (the laſt of
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:93273:119"/>
which muſt needs have been alive in his time, and poſſibly the other Two alſo) and do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without their Advice. For we find that at the firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from the Captivity, in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of much leſs moment, <hi>viz.</hi> where ſome that pretended to the Prieſthood could not prove their Pedigree, the Governour would determine nothing, but left the matter undecided, till a Prieſt ſhould ariſe who had <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi>
               <note n="q" place="margin">Ezr. 2.62, 63.</note>. And if any ſuch Prieſt did ariſe afterward, as, if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <hi>Joſephus,</hi> there did; for he tell us that that Oracle ceas'd but 200. years before his time<note n="r" place="margin">Antiq. Jud. l. 3. c. 9. p. 90. C. Ed. <hi>Gen.</hi>
               </note>, 'tis ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry probable that the Judgment of the Canonical Books was left to him, to determine which were ſuch, as the Learned Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> has made appear in the <hi>Appendix</hi>
               <note n="ſ" place="margin">Sect. 9.</note> to his <hi>Lectures,</hi> now in the Preſs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This Early date of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of the Old Teſtament, quite deſtroys that Fancy of our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors<note n="x" place="margin">Fr. p. 279. Eng p. 106.</note>, that the <hi>Jews put together all the Fragments that remain'd of
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:93273:120"/>
their Ancient Books, ſo that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of Scripture was their whole Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary.</hi> For in the Firſt place 'tis plain, that the <hi>Chronicles</hi> are Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts out of larger Records, which they often Refer to, and yet theſe Books were Compil'd after the Captivity, as appears by ſeveral paſſages<note n="y" place="margin">1 Chr. 3.17. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> &amp;c.</note> in them: and 'tis not likely that the Originals which eſcaped the Deſtruction of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, occaſion'd by the Ruine of the Commonwealth and the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity which enſu'd, ſhould be loſt in ſo little a time as was between the Compiling the <hi>Chronicles,</hi> and making the Canon. Eſpecially ſince <hi>Joſephus</hi>
               <note n="z" place="margin">L. 1. c. App. p. 136. D.</note> tells us, that the <hi>Genealogies of the High-Prieſts and their Succeſſion, for above Two Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years paſt, were preſerved in the Publick Records, and remain'd to his own time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, ſeveral Books which never were in the Canon, were Extant when the New Teſtament was writ, and are Cited there as Writings of Credit and Antiquity; ſuch as are the <hi>Prophecy of Enoch,</hi>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:93273:120"/>

               </note>. And 'twas from ſuch An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Writings probably, that <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus</hi> took ſome Stories which he relates of <hi>Moſes</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">Antiq. l. 2. c. 5.</note>, and of other Perſons. Beſides we find <hi>Apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phals</hi> quoted by <hi>Barnabas</hi> in every Page of his <hi>Epiſtle</hi> almoſt; by <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Alexandrinus</hi> and other An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Writers in ſeveral places, many of which 'tis likely, were Written Originally in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> ſince by the Matters they Treat of, we may reaſonably judge them to be as old as the Collection of the Canon: and were certainly lookt upon as Books of great Antiquity, or elſe they would not have been Cited by theſe Authors under the Venerable name of Scripture. From all which it appears, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilers of the Canon did not take in Promiſcuouſly whatever <hi>Hebrew</hi>
               <pb n="204" facs="tcp:93273:121"/>
Writings they could find; but uſed all poſſible diligence to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh Sacred Writings, and ſuch as were deſign'd by God for the Uſe of the Church, from thoſe which were not ſo. The Reaſons which Confute this Opinion of our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, concerning the Collection of the Canon of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I thought fit to repreſent all together, when I was upon this Subject, tho I am ſenſible that 'tis only the firſt of theſe Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which can be inferr'd as a Corollary from what has been ſaid concerning the Early Date of the Old Teſtament Canon.</p>
            <p>What I have hitherto ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Authority and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of the Old Teſtament Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, I cannot call Abſolutely Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain or Demonſtrative; but I may ſafely ſay thus much, that it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in it a greater Degree of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, than any thing the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries of the Canon have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd to the Contrary. So that tho we ſhould grant what our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ſays<note n="d" place="margin">Fr. p. 276. Eng. p. 102.</note>, <hi>That there is no proof at
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:93273:121"/>
all that</hi> Eſdras <hi>and the Great Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drim of that time, among whom were</hi> Haggai, Zachary <hi>and</hi> Malachi, <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pil'd the Canon;</hi> yet ſtill 'tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable 'twas made by thoſe that were ſo near their time, that they knew what their Sentiments were in this Matter, and made this Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection accordingly.</p>
            <p>But if this Proof be not thought Satisfactory, I ſhould think any Chriſtian ought to acquieſce in the Judgement of our Saviour: and 'tis plain he lookt upon the Jewiſh Canon, which was Undoubtedly the ſame in his time, which is now received in the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es: I ſay, he lookt upon it as a Collection of Holy Writings de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd by God for the Inſtruction of his Church, and the Rule the Jews were to have recourſe to, when they would inform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves what was the Will of God.

and ſo far ye are in the right, <hi>that ye have Eternal Life.</hi> 'Tis ſtrange our Saviour ſhould not correct this Miſtake of theirs, if ſome of the Books they had ſuch a great Veneration for, favour'd ſuch Dangerous Doctrines as our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor thinks the Book of <hi>Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtes</hi> does<note n="g" place="margin">Fr. p. 272.

'Tis ſtrange our Saviour<note n="i" place="margin">Luk. 24.44.</note> ſhould prove the Paſſion and Reſurrection of the Meſſias, not only out of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> but alſo out of the <hi>Pſalms;</hi> by which our Author<note n="k" place="margin">Fr. p. 277.

<pb n="207" facs="tcp:93273:122"/>
our Saviours Authority, by telling us<note n="l" place="margin">Fr. p. 278. Eng. p. 104, 105.</note>, that Chriſt never deſign'd <hi>to Criticize upon the Sacred Books, or to Correct thoſe Errors of the Jews, which were of ſmall Importance.</hi> But ſince our Saviour Criticiz'd ſo far upon the Sacred Books, as to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute the falſe Gloſſes<note n="m" place="margin">Matt. 5. c. 23.</note> which the Scribes and Phariſees had made upon them, and to Reject the Traditions<note n="n" place="margin">c. 15.1.</note> which they had E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall'd to the Word of God, and in ſome Caſes Prefer'd before it: it ſeems as neceſſary for him to have diſtinguiſht between the True Scriptures, and thoſe Books which were Undeſervedly eſteem'd ſuch. Eſpecially if theſe Latter advance Doctrines, that do not well agree with the Former, as our Author<note n="o" place="margin">Fr. p. 272, &amp;c.

Equal a Book that is not Inſpir'd when it contains Falſe Doctrine, with one that is truly Divine, than to Equal ſuch Traditions as the Phariſees held, with an Inſpir'd Writing. Becauſe a Tradition will probably in time be forgotten, and ſo loſe all its Authority, which we ſee has been the Fate of moſt of the <hi>Phariſaical</hi> Traditions; whereas a Book that has once been generally Reputed of Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, 'tis likely will maintain that Character for ever. For its very Character will make Men careful to preſerve it, and the Older it grows, the Stronger will the Plea of Preſcription be for its Divine Original: and Conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the More will be Impos'd upon by it, as we ſee hath Actually happen'd in the Caſe we are now ſpeaking of, if our Author's Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion be true. For the whole Chriſtian and Jewiſh Church hath time out of mind, lookt upon the Books contain'd in the Jewiſh Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non to be Inſpir'd, and have upon all Occaſions appeal'd to their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:93273:124"/>
as ſuch. From whence it appears, that our Saviours taking notice of this Error, if it had been one, would have been much more beneficial to after Ages, than his Confuting an Unwritten Tradition could be.</p>
            <p>But further, we find the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Judgment does evidently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur with our Saviours in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays<note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 3.2.</note>, that <hi>the Jews were intruſted</hi>

               <hi>with the Oracles of God:</hi> but ſurely he would have told us that they were not True to their Truſt, if he had thought they had mix'd Prophane Books with the Sacred ones. But that Text of the ſame Apoſtle,<note n="c" place="margin">2 Tim. 3.16.</note> 
               <hi>All Scripture is given by Inſpiration of God,</hi> is ſo clear a Proof of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles Judgment in this matter, that 'twill admit of no Evaſion. For the Apoſtle tells <hi>Timothy</hi> in the foregoing Verſe, that <hi>from a child he had known the Scriptures,</hi> by which he muſt mean the Body of Writings which the Jews look'd upon as ſuch, for in that Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he had been Educated by the
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:93273:125"/>
Care of his mother, who was a Jeweſs<note n="d" place="margin">Act. 16.1.</note>. Then it follows in this verſe, <hi>All Scripture is given by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration of God:</hi> where the Apoſtle certainly underſtands the word Scripture in the ſame ſenſe which he took it in the Verſe before, <hi>viz.</hi> for that Collection of Writings which the Jews received as the Word of God. But pray let us hear our Authors Paraphraſe<note n="e" place="margin">Eng. p. 192. Fr. p. 270.</note> upon theſe two Verſes, <hi>It is as if he had ſaid to</hi> Timothy, <hi>that he ought to keep cloſe as he had done hitherto, to the Study of the Old Teſtament, which would inſtruct him ſufficiently in the way of Salvation, by joyning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto Faith in Chriſt Jeſus: becauſe all Scripture Inſpired,</hi> AS IS A GREAT PART OF THE OLD TESTA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENT, <hi>Is profitable for Inſtruction.</hi> I think I may appeal to any Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Man, whether thoſe words of this Paraphraſe, <hi>[As is a great part of the Old Teſtament]</hi> be not added meerly to ſerve the preſent Turn, without the leaſt Intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch a Reſtriction from the Text it ſelf: and whether the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence

of theſe two Verſes be not plainly this, <q>Continue in the Study of the Old Teſtament, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all the Books which that conſiſts of are Divinely Inſpir'd.</q> But I ſuppoſes he grounds this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of his upon that Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Text, for which <hi>Grotius</hi>

               </gap> in the <hi>Verſe</hi> before, both which Expreſſions ſignify the Old Teſtament, becauſe 'tis a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:93273:126"/>
of Inſpir'd Writings: and conſequently the Phraſe it ſelf aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts ſo much by way of Implica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or elſe it would be an Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Expreſſion.</p>
            <p>I think it appears from what has been ſaid, what was the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt and his Apoſtles concerning the Canon of the Old Teſtament: and ſince 'tis certain that they approved the Canon of the Old Teſtament, as it was received by the Jewiſh Church of their own time, I can't gueſs what evidence of Reaſon can be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to perſwade a Chriſtian to Oppoſe ſuch an Authority. And therefore I can't be of our Author's mind, when he tell us<note n="i" place="margin">Eng. p. 188. Fr. p. 267.</note>, <hi>He knows not why we may not doubt of the Books of the Old Teſtament, as well as of ſome of the New, the Authority of ſeveral of the Latter having been queſtion'd.</hi> But there is a viſible Difference between the Authorities that confirm the Old Teſtament Canon, and thoſe which give Teſtimony to the New. To the Former Chriſt and his Apoſtles bear Witneſs, whereas the Credit
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:93273:127"/>
of the Latter depends upon the Conſent and Teſtimony of much the Greater part of the Church in the Ages ſucceeding that of the Apoſtles: which tho it be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for any Wiſe and Unpreju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic'd Man to ground his aſſent upon, yet it hath not that Sacred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Infallibility in it which the other hath. For thoſe Ages made uſe only of Humane Means for ſettling the New Teſtament Canon, which was ſufficient for that purpoſe, conſidering the Near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thoſe times to the Writing of the Books to which they give Teſtimony.</p>
            <p>Nor does the name of <hi>Chetubim,</hi> which the Jews give to thoſe Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the Old Teſtament, which Mr. <hi>N.</hi> calls in queſtion, at all ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify his Opinion. He fancies<note n="k" place="margin">Fr. p. 276. En. p. 102.</note> they were call'd <hi>Chetubim, i. e. Simply Writings,</hi> as he Interprets it, to ſignify that they were like other Humane Writings, and had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all of Inſpiration in them. But the Jewiſh Writers ſay not one Syllable to confirm this Opinion,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:93273:127"/>
that I can find. On the contrary, by their placing <hi>Daniel</hi> among the <hi>Chetubim,</hi> it appears that they look upon the Writers of that Claſs to have been Inſpir'd, for the Jews all agree that <hi>Daniel</hi> had really the Gift of Prophecy, tho they fancy it to be in a lower Degree. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Maimonides</hi> ſaith expreſly<note n="l" place="margin">More Nevoch. p. 2. c. 45.</note> that they are called <hi>Chetubim, quia ſcripta ſunt per Spiritum Sanctum.</hi> And tho he reckons that Impulſe which he calls <hi>Spiritus Sanctus,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to the Degree of Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which <hi>Iſaiah</hi> and the other Prophets properly ſo call'd, had: yet 'tis plain that he looks upon it as a proper kind of Inſpiration, for the inſtances he gives of it are, by his own Confeſſion, real Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations<note n="m" place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Smiths</hi> Diſcourſe of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy. c. 7.</note>. So that I do not ſee how <hi>Maimonides,</hi> take his Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation altogether, gives any Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to this Opinion, tho <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
               <note n="n" place="margin">
                  <hi>Votum pro pace,</hi> prout ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatur, Fr. p. 231. Eng. p. 141.</note> quote him for it. The Jews do indeed acknowledge a Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the Inſpiration of the <hi>Hagiographa</hi> and the Propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Writings, but this doth not
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:93273:128"/>
prove them to be no part of the Scripture: for I think there is no body that conſiders the manner of the Spirit's Operation upon the Minds of Inſpir'd Perſons, but will readily acknowledge that there's no need of the ſame De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Inſpiration, to write a Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory or a Book of Morality, as is requiſite to make a Prophet. But concerning the different De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Inſpiration, I have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd already in ſeveral places of this Treatiſe, and ſhall have Occaſion to ſpeak of it hereafter.</p>
            <p>But if the Jewiſh Diviſion of the Old Teſtament favour'd Mr. <hi>N</hi>'s Opinion never ſo much, I do not ſee any Force at all in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument taken from thence: for that Diviſion is not of ſo early a Date, as to be able to vye with the much Ancienter Opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Inſpiration of the whole Jewiſh Canon. St. <hi>Jerom</hi> is the firſt that I find takes notice of this Diviſion<note n="o" place="margin">Prolog. Galeat. Praef. in <hi>Daniel.</hi>
               </note>: the placing the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> among the <hi>Chetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bim</hi> in this Diviſion, beſides that
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:93273:128"/>
there is no ſhadow of Reaſon for it, except it be that the Jews bear him a Spight for Prophecying ſo plainly of our Saviour, diſcovers that 'tis of no long ſtanding, ſince 'tis contrary to the Senſe of the Ancient Jews. For <hi>Joſephus</hi> often calls <hi>Daniel a Prophet</hi>
               <note n="p" place="margin">Antiq. l. 10. c. 12.</note>, <hi>nay one of the greateſt</hi>

               </note> 
               <hi>Prophets.</hi> And agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to the Received Opinion, our Saviour gives him the ſame Title<note n="r" place="margin">Matth. 24.15.</note>. But further, the ſame <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus</hi>
               <note n="ſ" place="margin">L. 1. c. App. p. 1036. G.</note> makes uſe of another Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of the Old Teſtament Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, <hi>viz.</hi> into the <hi>Books of Moſes,</hi> the <hi>Prophetical,</hi> (under which he comprehends the Hiſtorical, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were writ by Prophets, as he with very good Reaſon ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes) and the <hi>Poetical Books,</hi> as they are commonly call'd, or <hi>thoſe which contain Hymns to God, and Precepts of good Life.</hi> Which Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion agrees much better with that mention'd by our Saviour<note n="t" place="margin">Luke 24.44.</note>, <hi>viz.</hi> into the <hi>Books of Moſes, the Prophets, and the Pſalms,</hi> than the other which the Jews have ſince that time Invented.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="218" facs="tcp:93273:129"/>Thus far I have ſhew'd that Mr. <hi>N.</hi> by rejecting ſome of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd Books of the Jewiſh Canon, rejects the Authority of the whole Jewiſh and Chriſtian Church, nay and of Chriſt and his Apoſtles too. What Reaſons he has for this we ſhall ſee by and by, but at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent let us examine what Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity he has to oppoſe to ſuch a Powerful one, as all theſe join'd together amount to. And I can find no body that ſtands by him in this Opinion but <hi>Grotius,</hi> and him he calls in to his Aſſiſtance at every Turn. But tho I have a great value for <hi>Grotius</hi>'s Judgment, yet I think if it be laid in the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance to counterpoiſe that of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, 'twill be found too Light. That Great man's Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Learning and Merits, and particularly his having ſo well deſerv'd of ſeveral Parts of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and given ſuch Light into their true Senſe and Deſign, makes me willing to paſs over his Fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lures, and not be ſevere upon his Memory for thoſe Falſe Gloſſes,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:93273:129"/>
and ſome of them deſerve a Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Name, which he has made upon other Books of it. Only I can't but obſerve, that this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of his, concerning the Old Teſtament Canon, is very Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the Main Deſign of his <hi>Votum pro Pace,</hi> and thoſe other Treatiſes where he has aſſerted it. For the Great Deſign of thoſe <hi>Projects for Peace,</hi> is to magnify Antiquity, Tradition, and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Church, and to ſhew that Catholick Unity is never to be reſtor'd, but by ſubmitting all Controverſies to the Deciſion of theſe three, as ſo many Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors or Umpires between the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Parties. And yet at the ſame time when he Pleads for the Authority of the Church, of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity and Tradition, he Rejects thoſe Books which have all the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority that the Univerſal Church, Uninterrupted Tradition, and the Conſent of all the Ancients, both Jews and Chriſtians can give them.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="220" facs="tcp:93273:130"/>II. I come now in the Second Place to conſider the <hi>Exceptions which our Author makes, againſt Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Books of the Old Teſtament:</hi> and the Books he Excepts againſt are either <hi>Hiſtorical,</hi> or thoſe they commonly call <hi>Poetical.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the Hiſtorical Writings I agree with him thus far, that the Sacred Hiſtorians were not uſually Inſpir'd with the things themſelves which they relate, nor with the Words by which they Expreſs the things. But I think I have prov'd in the Firſt Chapter<note n="u" place="margin">P. 37.</note> of this Treatiſe, that a Book may be written by God's Direction, and yet not without the Uſe of Humane means. And as there is no Reaſon to think, that God Inſpir'd the <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts</hi> with the Knowledge of thoſe Paſſages of our Saviour's Life, which they themſelves were Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſſes of, or might eaſily learn from thoſe that were ſo: ſo 'tis every whit as groundleſs to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that God Reveal'd thoſe Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars to the Writers of the Old Teſtament Hiſtory, which they
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:93273:130"/>
could come to the Knowledge of by Conſulting the Records and Ancient Monuments, in which theſe Matters were related. But notwithſtanding this, 'twill appear that theſe Books were writ by God's Direction, and Deſign'd by him for the Uſe of the Church, if we conſider what Mr. <hi>N.</hi> himſelf grants<note n="x" place="margin">Fr. p. 231. En. p. 28.</note>, <hi>That they were not writ meerly to ſatisfy our Curioſity, but to be a ſtanding proof of a Providence to after Ages, to ſhew us the Care that God always takes of Good Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the Puniſhments he inflicts upon the Wicked: to give us Examples of Piety and Vertue, and laſtly to inform us of ſeveral Matters of Fact, which tend very much to confirm our Faith,</hi> as containing many Types and Predictions of our Saviour. To which we may add, that ſetting aſide the Squabbles between <hi>F. Simon</hi> and his Adverſaries, about the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Keepers of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Regiſters</hi> of the Jews, 'tis highly probable, that the Prophets uſually writ the Hiſtories of their Kings, and thoſe Books which are ſo
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:93273:131"/>
often quoted under the name of the <hi>Chronicles of the Kings of Judah and Iſrael,</hi> and were Annals from whence the Subſtance of the Books of <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Chronicles</hi> are taken. For we find a Conſiderable part of the Hiſtory of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> Incorporated into <hi>Iſaiah's</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy<note n="a" place="margin">Iſ. c. 36, 37, 38, 39.</note>, which is a Strong Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption that the whole Hiſtory of that King's Reign, was Recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the ſame Hand.

The Care of writing them was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Prophets, as the other Paſſage aſſures us, not Excluding thoſe Prieſts who had the Gift of Prophecy: the Preſerving them he here tells us, was particularly the Buſineſs of the Prieſts, who likewiſe exactly Preſerved the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogies of their Nation, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed them when the Copies were Impair'd, and in danger to be all loſt by Wars and other Accidents, and therefore were lookt upon as the Keepers of the Publick Records.

            <p>But to return to our Subject, From thoſe many Inſtances I have given, which ſhew 'twas a Cuſtom among the Jews for the Prophets to be their Hiſtorians, we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that the Hiſtorical Books of the Old Teſtament were writ by Men who had the Gift of Prophecy and Inſpiration: and tho we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them to be but Abridgements of the larger Commentaries of the Prophets, yet they are really of as much Authority as thoſe very An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals would be which were writ by the Prophets themſelves, if they were extant. For if an <hi>Epitome</hi> be faithfully made (and I ſuppoſe Mr. <hi>N.</hi> does not queſtion the Fidelity of the Sacred Hiſtorians) whatever is contained in it, hath the ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Credibility with the Original Writing. So that if we lay
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:93273:133"/>
all theſe things together, the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the Compilers of theſe Hiſtorical Books, the Matter and Deſign of them, the Authority of the Jewiſh Canon, and above all that of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, theſe are ſufficient Inducements to believe theſe Books to be Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by God's Direction for the Benefit of the Church. And this I think is enough to give Divine Authority to an Hiſtorical Book, tho neither the Matter nor Words of it be indited by Inſpiration.</p>
            <p>As for the Hiſtory of <hi>Eſther</hi> Mr. <hi>N.</hi> has taken much pains<note n="o" place="margin">Fr. p. 164, &amp;c. Eng. p. 249.</note>, and ſhewed a great deal of Skill in the Rules of <hi>Dramatick</hi> Poeſy, and all to prove that this Book looks like a Fiction and a piece of <hi>Tragi-Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</hi> He indeed tells us, that he <hi>affirms nothing in this matter, and does not intend to make himſelf a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Diſpute.</hi> But a man would hardly take ſo much pains to make anothers Opinion look probable, if he did not think it ſo himſelf. But whatever his own Sentiments be, to ſhew himſelf Impartial, and
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:93273:133"/>
that he is reſolv'd not to conceal any thing that may be ſaid on the other ſide, he Critically remarks<note n="p" place="margin">Eng. p. 169. Fr. p. 252.</note> that one Condition, neceſſary to be obſerv'd in Dramatick Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, is wanting, <hi>viz. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of Time and Place,</hi> which muſt needs ſeem a conſiderable Objection to ſo nice a Judge. But beſides this, there's another Objection which I confeſs has more Weight with me, and ſeems quite to turn the Scales, and make his Remarks appear meer Fancy and Fiction, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Feaſt of <hi>Purim</hi> was really ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by the Jews, in memory of the Deliverance recorded in this Book. And 'twill be a hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to make me believe that a whole Nation ſhould keep an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſary Feaſt, as 'tis certain they did<note n="q" place="margin">2 Mac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> 15.36.</note>, without ſome real Ground for it. And if this was not the true Occaſion of it, as he ſeems to inſinuate<note n="r" place="margin">Eng. p 170. Fr. p. 253.</note>, I deſire either he would prove the Feaſt to be as very a Fiction, as he ſuppoſes the Hiſtory is, or elſe inform us how the whole Nation of the Jews

came to be ſo far impos'd upon, as to obſerve it: for till he does one of theſe two things, I ſhall ſtill be of opinion, that the one was a Real Feaſt, and the other a True Hiſtory.</p>
            <p>But tho this Play does not ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, he is reſolved not to give over, but try his Skill upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Subject, and turn the Book of <hi>Job</hi> into a <hi>Tragi-Comedy</hi>

And I confeſs this Book is made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Rules of Poetry, and with all the Beauties of it too, as an Ordinary Reader may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily diſcover under all the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages of a Tranſlation. And therefore methinks our Author, who underſtands the Rules and <hi>Decorums</hi> of Poetry ſo well, ſhould not be offended with thoſe Pathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic Strains, that are in the <hi>third Chapter,</hi> and ſome other places of that Book: for tho we ſhould grant that they would not become a grave Philoſophical Diſcourſe, yet I believe he might have found ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Speeches in the <hi>Old Tragedies</hi> written with as much Vehemence
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:93273:134"/>
and Warmth. And yet the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt Philoſophers commended thoſe Writings, and look'd upon them as containing very uſeful Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Life. And I ſee no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why God might not in this as well as other things, ſuffer the Holy Writers to comply ſo far with their own Genius, and the Humour which then prevail'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the grave Sages of the World, as to deliver Great and Weighty Truths in Poetical num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and Expreſſions, both to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend them to the more Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Nice Readers, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the Wiſe men of the World, who are apt to deſpiſe the Plainneſs of the Scriptures, that there are to be found as Elevated Thoughts, and as Noble Expreſſions in the Holy Writings, as any <hi>Greece</hi> or <hi>Rome</hi> can boaſt of: and therefore when they uſe a plain popular Style, 'tis not out of Neceſſity but Choice, and becauſe they rather aim at the Inſtruction of the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, than to gain Applauſe from the Learned<note n="t" place="margin">V. <hi>Orig.</hi> c. <hi>Celſ.</hi> p. 275, 371, 372.

perhaps will be ready to ſay, that theſe Expreſſions may do well in a Profane Poem, but are not ſo proper for a Sacred one, and do not become the mouth of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon eminent for Piety and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. In anſwer to which, I would deſire the Objectors in the firſt place to conſider that the Subſtance of the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Chapter of this Book, which ſo much offends Mr. <hi>N.</hi>

In the next place I would deſire them to reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe many Excellent Sayings in this Book, which are moſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Expreſſions of <hi>Jobs</hi> Patience, Submiſſion, and Reſignation to

And if they rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily acknowledge that upon theſe Accounts <hi>Job's</hi> Behaviour is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be recorded for an Example of Integrity, of Sufferings, and of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, let them withal conſider that the other parts of the Book which ſeem more liable to Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are of uſe to teach us, that the beſt of men are ſubject to the Paſſions and Infirmities to which Humane Nature is obnoxious, and are not able to bear up againſt the Firſt Aſſaults of Afflictions, and the ſudden and ſharp Twinges of Pain, till they have recollected their Strength, arm'd themſelves with new Vigour and Reſolution, and have incourag'd themſelves in God, and call'd in the Divine Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. Thus we find the Spirit of the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſtir'd in him at the Conſideration of the Proſperity of the Wicked<note n="a" place="margin">Pſ. 73.2, 3.</note>, and tempted to that
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:93273:136"/>
Degree of Impatience, as to begin to ſay, <hi>'Twas in vain to ſerve God</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">Ib v. 13. 14.</note>: but he preſently checks ſuch thoughts as unbecoming a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man<note n="c" place="margin">Ib. v. 15.</note>. And I queſtion not but God was pleas'd that thoſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of <hi>Job</hi> in which he ſeems to forget his Character, ſhould be Recorded as well as the Infirmities of other his eminent Servants, on purpoſe to ſhew us that they had the Heavenly <hi>Treaſure</hi> of Grace in <hi>Earthen Veſſels,</hi> and thereby teach us <hi>to ceaſe from</hi> valuing <hi>Man, for wherein is he to be accounted of?</hi> and to give God the Glory, and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify the Power of his Grace, <hi>whoſe Strength is made perfect in Weakneſs,</hi> and more eminently ſeen in the midſt of Humane Infirmities.</p>
            <p>And notwithſtanding theſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, 'tis no ſuch unaccountable thing as our Author ſuppoſes<note n="d" place="margin">Fr. p. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Suppoſe ye that theſe Galileans,</hi> whoſe Blood <hi>Pilate</hi> mingled with their Sacrifices, <hi>were ſinners above all the Galileans, becauſe they ſuffer'd theſe things? I tell you Nay.</hi> Whereas <hi>Job's</hi> Friends all along go upon this Principle, that Good Men are always Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous, and none are Miſerable but the Wicked: and to prove this they Appeal to Experience, the Hiſtories of Former Ages<note n="c" place="margin">Job 8.8. c. 15.10, 18.-20.4, &amp;c.—22.15, 16.</note>, and

the Examples which their own Times furniſht them with<note n="d" place="margin">c. 4.7, 8, 9, 10, 11.</note>. From all which they don't only conclude, as our Author Imperfectly Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents it,<note n="e" place="margin">Fr. p. 275. En. p. 101.</note> that <hi>Job was afflicted for his ſins,</hi> for if this had been all they had maintain'd, <hi>Job</hi> would never have conteſted the matter with them, for he freely acknowledges his ſins, and owns that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Puniſhment<note n="f" place="margin">Job 7.2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, 21.-9.14, 15.</note>. But that which they contend for is, that <hi>Job</hi> muſt needs be a Grievous Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and Greater than other Men, however he had made a Shift to conceal his Wickedneſs from the Eyes of the World, or elſe he had never been ſo terribly Afflicted. Nay, <hi>Eliphaz</hi> is ſo confident that it muſt be ſome Extraordinary Wickedneſs that had brought down theſe heavy Judgements upon him, that at laſt he ventures to give a Catalogue of <hi>Job's</hi> Sins<note n="g" place="margin">Job 22.5, &amp;c.</note>, for which God had thus Afflicted him. 'Twas this Uncharitable Behaviour of theirs provoked <hi>Job</hi> to Impatience, more than all the reſt of his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions: 'twas upon this account
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:93273:137"/>
he tells them, that <hi>they had Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached him ten times,</hi> had <hi>vext his ſoul,</hi> and <hi>broke him in pieces with words</hi>
               <note n="h" place="margin">Job 19.2, 3.</note>: this makes him ſo often proteſt his Innocency, and appeal to God to Judge him, <hi>according to the Integrity that was in him</hi>

And here I think <hi>Job's</hi> Friends were very faulty, not only in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing ſo raſhly concerning the Reaſons of Providence and of God's Judgements, but likewiſe in paſſing ſuch Unkind and Uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Cenſures upon their Friend, whereas they ought to have had <hi>pity upon him,</hi> as he tells them<note n="k" place="margin">c. 19.21, 22.</note>, <hi>ſince the Hand of God had toucht him,</hi> and not <hi>perſecute him as God,</hi> and add Affliction to the Afflicted. And this their Confidence in taking upon them to be Interpreters of God's Judgements, together with their Uncharitable and Inhumane Behaviour toward a Man in Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, might juſtly provoke God's Wrath againſt them for what they had ſaid, when at the ſame time he pardon'd the Impatient and Undecent Expreſſions of <hi>Job,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:93273:138"/>
he could plead the Infirmity of Humane Nature in his own be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, which is eaſily provok'd to be Impatient under violent Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, eſpecially where Men <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute thoſe whom God has ſmitten:</hi> whereas <hi>Job's</hi> Friends had no ſuch excuſe to alledge for themſelves.</p>
            <p>But ſtill it may be Demanded, Upon what account we Reckon this Book to be Inſpir'd? In An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to which Queſtion, I ſhall crave leave to deliver my Opinion Freely, but with all due Submiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Better Judgements.

But <hi>Job</hi> had the Gift of Prophecy in a more Eminent manner, as appears, not only from that Famous Paſſage of his<note n="t" place="margin">Job 19.25, 26, 27</note>, <hi>I know that my Redeemer lives, &amp;c.</hi> which St. <hi>Jerom</hi>

               <note n="y" place="margin">c. 42.5.</note>, or Viſible Appearance of the Divine Glory. But allowing all this, I ſee no proof that the Diſcourſes ſet down in this Book, ought to be lookt upon as ſpoken by the Spirit of Prophecy: and therefore the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration of the Book it ſelf, ſeems to me to conſiſt in this, <hi>viz.</hi> As 'tis an Hiſtorical account of <hi>Job's</hi> Behaviour before, and under his Afflictions, and of his happy Iſſue out of them all, together with his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections and the diſcourſes he had with his Friends upon that Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, written by God's Direction for the Uſe of his Church, to be an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Patience under Sufferings, and a Vindication of God's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in permitting the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to be Afflicted. And ſince by Reaſon of the Antiquity of the Book, the Author is not certainly known, and Conſequently we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Argue that 'tis Inſpired, from the Character of its Author; the Evidence for its being Inſpired, or
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:93273:139"/>
Written by God's Direction for the Uſe of the Church, muſt be Reſolved into the Authority of the Jewiſh Canon, as that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to us by Chriſt and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and this Book particularly Recommended by St. <hi>James</hi>
               <note n="z" place="margin">James 5.11.</note>, to the Uſe of Chriſtians: eſpecially ſince the Deſign of it does exactly Anſwer the Character which St. <hi>Paul</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And thus much I think may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, in Anſwer to Mr. <hi>N</hi>'s Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions againſt the Book of <hi>Job.</hi> I ſhall only add, that beſides the Powerful Comforts this Book af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords to the Afflicted, and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion it teaches us to yield to God's Will, and to Adore the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchableneſs of his Judgements, which are the principal and obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Deſigns of this Book, 'tis like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of excellent Uſe upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther account, <hi>viz.</hi> as it gives us a True Idea of <hi>Natural Religion</hi>

And this is one Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of it, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe all the Hymns Compos'd by the Ancient Chriſtians have been loſt time out of mind, except very few, which can be attributed to nothing ſo probably, as to the Difuſe of them, by reaſon of the more Frequent and Conſtant Uſe of the Book of Pſalms. And 'tis not likely the Chriſtian Church would have been beholding to the Jewiſh Temple for their Forms of Worſhip, (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when we conſider how much more Noble a Subject for Praiſes
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:93273:142"/>
and Hymns the Chriſtians had, by the Clear Revelation of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel) if they had not been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that God deſign'd the Book of Pſalms for the perpetual Uſe of the Church, to be both a Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern and Treaſure of Devotions, at once to Enlighten our Minds, and Warm our Affections, and teach us to Pray and Praiſe God <hi>with the Spirit, and with the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding alſo.</hi> And if what I have ſaid, prove that this was God's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in ſtirring up Holy Men to make theſe Excellent Pieces of Devotion, I think 'twill be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ſatisfy any Reaſonable Man, that the Book of Pſalms de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves a place among the Inſpir'd Writers, without Nicely determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning how great a ſhare the Holy Spirit had in making theſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſures, and how much is to be aſcribed to the Authors own Study and Meditation. Since 'tis very hard in any Caſe, to Define the manner how God's Grace does Cooperate with Man's Indeavours, and the Spirit, like the Wind to
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:93273:143"/>
which our Saviour compares it<note n="t" place="margin">John 3.8.</note>, does ſufficiently diſcover it ſelf by its effects, tho we can't Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the Manner of its Operation.

            <p n="1">1. In the Firſt place therefore, I deſire it may be Obſerved, that <hi>many of thoſe Expreſſions which ſeems at firſt Sight to import Wiſhing Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief and Deſtruction to others, do really wiſh no more harm to them, than

            <p n="2">2. Secondly, let it be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that <hi>all thoſe Expreſſions which are commonly Tranſlated by way of Imprecation, may be as fitly rendred by way of Prediction:</hi> and we may Read, <hi>They ſhall be Aſhamed,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of <hi>Let them be Aſhamed.</hi> Nay this way of Interpretation is more agreeable to the Letter of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew,</hi> where the words are not in the <hi>Imperative</hi> but in the <hi>Future.</hi>
               <pb n="248" facs="tcp:93273:144"/>
And if we take theſe Expreſſions in this Senſe, then they imply no more than a Denouncing God's Judgements againſt Wicked Men, if they ſtill perſiſt in their Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And thus to Denounce the <hi>Terrors of the Lord</hi> againſt Sinners, is ſo far from being a piece of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitableneſs, that 'tis the higheſt Act of Charity we can ſhew to them, and the moſt effectual means to awaken them to a ſenſe of their Condition, and what they are to Expect except they Repent.

<pb n="250" facs="tcp:93273:145"/>
with that Language, will furniſh a man with ſeveral Examples of this kind.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But Thirdly, if we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand theſe Expreſſions according to their common Acceptation and the Senſe that is uſually given of them, and ſuppoſe them to imply Wiſhing evil to the Perſons of whom they are ſpoken, I cannot ſee but <hi>'tis Lawful, nay our Duty in ſeveral Caſes to pray to God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our Enemies,</hi> and deſire him to execute his Vengeance upon them: the Lawfulneſs of this I ſhall prove in theſe following Inſtances.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Where 'tis not a Private Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, but one of a Publick Nature, between two different Nations,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon a Civil or Religious Account. For in this Caſe, as it is lawful for the Injur'd Party to indeavour to Right themſelves by War, ſo they may certainly Pray to God that he would give them Succeſs, and overthrow their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies: eſpecially if their Attempts be levell'd againſt the True Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, for then beſide the Reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nableneſs
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:93273:145"/>
of Praying to God to <hi>maintain his own Cauſe,</hi> we may Pray that the Enemies of it may meet with a Remarkable Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, upon another Account too: becauſe it will be a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Argument for their Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to bring them to the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of the Truth. To which purpoſe the Pſalmiſt prays,<note n="k" place="margin">Pſal. 83.16.</note> 
               <hi>Fill their faces with ſhame, O Lord, that they may ſeek thy Name.</hi> And accordingly thoſe Pſalms which were compos'd againſt the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Jewiſh Church and Nation, may now lawfully be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed againſt the Enemies of the True Religion, and of thoſe that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it: and we find they have all along been applied ſo in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>'Tis lawful to pray againſt our Enemies, when they are the Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Publick Peace.</hi> For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the Charity which we owe to the Community lays upon us a Precedent and a higher Oliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than that which we owe to Private Perſons, and therefore
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:93273:146"/>
where theſe two interfere, the Firſt Obligation muſt take place, and 'tis not only lawful but our Duty to ſhew no Kindneſs to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſons, where we cannot do it without Prejudice to the Publick. Or elſe I do not ſee how it would be conſiſtent with Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Charity to puniſh Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors: and ſure Wiſhing Evil is not more contrary to the Rules of Charity than Inflicting it. Now many of the Imprecations which we find in the Pſalms, are againſt the Diſturbers of the Publick Peace, for they were not the Enemies of a Private man, but of <hi>David</hi> a King, and one of God's own Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment too. And certainly in ſuch Caſes where men are bound to the utmoſt of their Ability, to bring Offenders to Condign Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, they may every whit as lawfully leave them to God's Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and deſire him to take the matter into his own Hand, and Reward them according to their Works. Eſpecially if we conſider that in <hi>David</hi>'s Caſe, where a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:93273:146"/>
Authority was Oppreſs'd and Injur'd by Wicked men, there no Court upon Earth could do him Right, for he that was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God to be an <hi>Avenger and to execute Wrath upon them that do Evil,</hi> had this Power taken from him: ſo that in this Caſe 'twas ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fit and juſt for him to Appeal to God, and deſire that he would execute Judgment upon obſtinate Offenders, who elſe would eſcape the Hand of Juſtice.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Tis lawful to pray to God to ſend down Judgments upon our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, when 'tis not likely they will be Reform'd by Gentler Methods.</hi> Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners often deſpiſe the Patience and Long-ſuffering of God, and take Incouragement from his Forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to go on in their Sins: and when nothing will work upon them but <hi>Judgment</hi> and <hi>Fiery Indignation,</hi> 'tis a piece of Charity to pray to God to correct them and bring them under the Rod, till they know that the <hi>moſt High rules over the Children of men.</hi> Thus the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt prays to God againſt Harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:93273:147"/>
Sinners,<note n="l" place="margin">Pſal. 59.13.</note> 
               <hi>Conſume them in thy wrath that they may not be: and let them know that God rules in Jacob, and unto the Ends of the Earth.</hi> This ſevere dealing with ſuch perſons will force them at laſt to Glorifie God, and others warn'd by their Examples, will be the more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful not to offend in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
            <p>And this leads me to the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and Laſt Inſtance I ſhall mention, wherein 'tis lawful to pray againſt our Enemies, and that is, <hi>When Offenders are in all appearance In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrigible and paſt Repentance.</hi> When men have made themſelves Unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of God's Mercy, 'tis fit that God ſhould be Glorified in them by making them Remarkable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of his Juſtice: and 'tis the Duty of every one that is Zealous of God's Glory, to deſire and pray that he may <hi>get Honour</hi> by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Hardned and Incorri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible Sinners, as he did by the Overthrow of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>
               <note n="m" place="margin">Exod. 14.17.</note>: and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they ought to Rejoyce when they ſee it accompliſh'd, And ſurely
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:93273:147"/>
when Charity has done her work, when Patience and Kindneſs can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſoften our Enemies, nor Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for their Converſion do any Good upon them, it ſeems very agreeable to the Doctrine of the Scriptures, that then we may pray God to execute his Vengeance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them: as ſome of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans when they ſaw <hi>Julian the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtate's</hi> Implacable Rage and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate Malice againſt the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, believing him to have Sinn'd the <hi>Sin unto Death,</hi> pray'd to God for his Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that <hi>all the Kingdoms of the Earth might know that</hi> Jeſus <hi>whom</hi> Julian <hi>had reproched, was Lord and Chriſt</hi>

<pb n="260" facs="tcp:93273:150"/>
there are many Expreſſions like this in the Prophets: where they incourage and commend, and promiſe a Reward to thoſe men who are to be Executioners of God's Judgments<note n="i" place="margin">Jer. 25.9.-27.6, 7.8.-43.10.-50.14, 21, 26, 29.

            <p>I think there is no ſort of Impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations uſed in the Pſalms, but ſomething which has been offer'd in theſe Three Conſiderations will reach to, and will be a ſufficient Defence and Juſtification of. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I will add one brief Remark, for the ſake of thoſe who do not converſe with the <hi>Originals</hi> or the <hi>Ancient Verſions</hi> of the Bible, and that is this; That the word<note n="l" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<pb n="261" facs="tcp:93273:150"/>
is ſometimes Tranſlated <hi>Hell</hi> in the Pſalms, and in ſeveral other places of the Old Teſtament, ſignifies on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Grave,</hi> and ought to have been always Tranſlated ſo, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the Miſunderſtanding of theſe places. So that when the Pſalmiſt ſays,<note n="m" place="margin">Pſal. 55.15.</note> 
               <hi>Let Death come haſtily upon them, and let them go down quick in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Hell,</hi> the Expreſſion ſounds harſh to a Vulgar ear, and taking it in the moſt obvious ſenſe of the words can hardly be defended, but it really means no more but this, <q>Let them ſuddenly go down into the Grave, before they have time to accompliſh their Wicked Deſigns:</q> the later words being the ſame ſenſe with the former, only differently expreſs'd.</p>
            <p>Next in order to the Pſalms are the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> and therefore I ſhall in the next place conſider the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections which our Author advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces againſt them. One would think that the Character which the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Hiſtory<note n="n" place="margin">1 Kin. 3.12.</note> and all ages have given to <hi>Solomon,</hi> of being indow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God with an Extraordinary
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:93273:151"/>
Degree of Wiſdom above all other men: together with what he ſays of himſelf, that he imploy'd this Talent to the Inſtruction of the people, and <hi>gather'd together many Proverbs</hi>
               <note n="o" place="margin">Eccleſ. 12.9.</note> to that end: and beſides all this, the Authority of the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Canon, eſpecially when 'tis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd by a <hi>Greater than Solomon,</hi> our Saviour CHRIST, and ſeveral Paſſages of this very Book dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly quoted by his Apoſtles<note n="p" place="margin">Rom. 12.20. Hebr. 12.5, 6. Jam. 4.6. 1 Pet. 5.5.</note>, and other places plainly alluded<note n="q" place="margin">2 Cor. 8.21. 1 Pet. 4.18.</note> to by them: I ſay, one would be apt to conclude that all theſe Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions added to the Intrinſecal Worth of the Book it ſelf, might be a ſufficient Inducement to look upon it as a Book compos'd by God's Appointment for the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the Church.</p>
            <p>But before I proceed any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon this Sebject, I cannot but reflect by the way upon a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of our Author, which the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving that this Book is quoted by the Apoſtles puts me in mind of, and that is this: He tells us<note n="r" place="margin">Fr. p. 278. Eng. p. 105</note> 
               <hi>That the Apoſtles never cite the
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:93273:151"/>
works of</hi> Solomon <hi>or the Book of</hi> Job. What he ſays touching the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, I have juſt now ſhewed to be manifeſtly Falſe, and there is as little truth in the later part of his words: for the Book of <hi>Job</hi> is as formally quoted by St. <hi>Paul</hi>
               <note n="ſ" place="margin">1 Cor. 3.19.</note>, as any Book of the Old Teſtament, <hi>The Wiſdom of the world is Fooliſhneſs with God,</hi> FOR IT IS WRITTEN, <hi>He taketh the Wiſe in their own Craftineſs.</hi> Which Citation, as 'tis certainly taken out of <hi>Job</hi>
               <note n="t" place="margin">c. 5. 13.</note>, ſo it ſhews withal a great Deference given by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle to the Authority of the Book from whence 'tis taken. I thought fit juſt to obſerve this Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake of Mr. <hi>N.</hi>'s, tho it be of no great conſequence, on purpoſe to take down the Confidence of this Gentleman a little, and ſhew him that he is not ſo exactly vers'd in the Scripture, as a man that undertakes to Criticize upon it with ſo much Capriciouſneſs, and ſo little Reverence and Regard to its Authority, ought to be.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="264" facs="tcp:93273:152"/>But to return to the Matter in hand. The Sum of the General Charge which our Author has ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd againſt the Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Book of <hi>Proverbs</hi> is<note n="a" place="margin">Fr. p. 271. En. p. 94.</note>, <hi>That they are Moral Sentences which a Good Man may pronounce without Inſpiration.</hi> As if no Book could be writ by God's Direction, but where the matter is ſuch as exceeds the reach of Humane Invention, and cannot be the Product of our Rational Faculties. And then by the ſame Reaſon no work muſt be aſcribed to God, but what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds the Power of Natural Agents; and ſo God muſt be accounted the Author of nothing that happens in the World, but what is purely Miraculous. Now this Argument if it prove any thing at all, it proves not only that this Book is not written by Divine Inſpiration, but farther, that no Book of Moral Inſtructions can be. For Morality is nothing but the <hi>Law of Right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, inſtructing us how to govern our Actions;</hi> and I ſuppoſe the Law of Reaſon contains nothing in it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:93273:152"/>
Reaſon, and Conſequently nothing which is above the Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of a Wiſe and Good Man to think or ſpeak: from all which it will follow, by our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors Principles, that whatever Book contains nothing in it but what is deducible from the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of meer Reaſon, muſt be purely Humane, and can have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing Divine, or of the Hand of God in it. But is not Mr. <hi>N.</hi> ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that the Corruption of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, the Degeneracy of the World, the Uncertainty of Humane Reaſoning, and eſpecially the Imperfect Knowledge we have of the Nature of God and our own Souls, have ſo far Obſcur'd a great many branches of this Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or Reaſon, that there was need of a more than Ordinary Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination, to recover ſome Truths which were in a manner loſt to the World, and to ſet them in a True Light, ſo as to Convince o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of their Certainty and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency? Sure our Author will grant, that the Unity of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:93273:153"/>
is a Truth that is Adequate to Humane Reaſon, nay a Truth ſo Evident, that one would won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Men of Searching Heads could miſs of it; and yet we find there were very few among the Heathens that had their Reaſon ſo throughly purg'd from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices which Education and the Eſtabliſht Religion of the World had infected it with, as to aſſent to this Truth. And I think this is a ſufficient Proof that Men may ſtand in need of a Teacher Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely Inlightned to Diſcover ſuch Truths to them, as may indeed be deduced from the Principles of Reaſon when 'tis in its true perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but yet are ſuch as few Men's Reaſon hath arrived to, becauſe of the Degeneracy and corruption to which 'tis obnoxious. And many ſuch Truths are to be found in this Book, which tho they are ſo reaſonable that Men can't but aſſent to them aſſoon as they hear them, yet 'tis in vain to ſearch for them in the Writings of the Beſt and Acuteſt Philoſophers. For
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:93273:153"/>
Inſtance, we may challenge them to ſhew ſuch a Wiſe Inſtruction in any of their Books as <hi>Solomon</hi> lays down for the foundation of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality,<note n="b" place="margin">Prov. 1.7.</note> 
               <hi>The fear of the Lord is the beginning of Wiſdom:</hi> or this,<note n="c" place="margin">Prov. 3.5, 6</note> 
               <hi>Truſt in the Lord with all thy Heart and lean not to thy own <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, In all thy ways acknowledge him.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed thro the whole Book the Duties of Morality are inforc'd upon Men from Religious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, and by Arguments taken from the Duty we owe to God, and the Rewards and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments we muſt expect from him, according as we behave our ſelves. Which makes this Book differ ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much from the Moral Writings of the Philoſophers, where we ſhall find little or nothing ſaid concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Duty to God, his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over us, our Dependance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and the Submiſſion we owe to him, the Methods of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and the Rewards or Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments of another Life, all which are often inſiſted upon in this Book. For this is a viſible
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:93273:154"/>
Defect in the Writings of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, that as they never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force our Duty by Arguments which are taken from the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Religion: ſo their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſives from Vice are taken from theſe Topicks, <hi>viz.</hi> That 'tis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Dignity of Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and a Contradiction to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, rather than from this Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, That 'tis diſpleaſing to God, a Breach of his Law, and an Act of Diſobedience which he will Puniſh. I Confeſs ſome Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers that lived ſince the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Chriſtianity, eſpecially the Emperor <hi>Antoninus,</hi> have very Excellent Sayings concerning God's Providence, and the Submiſſion we owe to him. But I am apt to think, that as the Light of the Goſpel Diffus'd it ſelf over the World, it in ſome meaſure Inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the minds even of thoſe who Refus'd to imbrace it, as the Sun gives Light before it reaches our Hemiſphere. My meaning is, that the very Account which Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Men received of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:93273:154"/>
of Chriſtianity helped to Clear up their minds, and gave them more diſtinct Apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Principles of Natural Religon than they had before.</p>
            <p>But to return; Beſide the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts I have already mention'd, there are many Excellent Advices given in the <hi>Proverbs</hi> to all ſorts and Degrees of Men, from Princes and Magiſtrates to the meaneſt of their Subjects. And 'tis meer Cavilling in this Author to ſay<note n="d" place="margin">Ubi ſupr.</note>, That <hi>the Directions about Good Husbandry and Houſe-keeping, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try People know without Inſpiration:</hi> as if it were below the Wiſdom of an Inſpired Teacher, to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the meaneſt of their Duty; (as certainly 'tis every Man's to be Diligent in his Calling) and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them to attend upon it<note n="e" place="margin">See Tit. 3.14. where the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle gives the ſame ſort of Advice:</note>: or as if People had not need to be put in mind of their Duty, altho they knew it before. As little weight is there in what he ſaith<note n="f" place="margin">Ubi ſup.</note> concerning the Caution which this Book ſo often gives Men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Suretiſhip,</hi> or <hi>being Bound for
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:93273:155"/>
others,</hi> as if it <hi>amounted to a total forbidding Men the Exerciſe of this ſort of Charity.</hi> I grant him this may be in ſome Caſes a very good Act of Charity; but if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it as 'tis generally practis'd, (and <hi>Proverbial Sayings</hi> are to be underſtood only to hold true in <hi>Moſt caſes</hi>) we ſhall find ſuch ill Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of it, that 'tis not only Wiſe but Religious Advice to warn men againſt it. Experience tells us that men are often Bound for more than they are able to pay, which is the very Caſe <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks of<note n="g" place="margin">Prov. 22.26, 27.</note> in ſome of thoſe places Mr. <hi>N.</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to, and ſo injure the Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor as well as undo themſelves and intail Miſery upon their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, which a man is bound in Juſtice as well as Charity to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for in the firſt place. And Suretiſhip when it brings men to Beggary, at the ſame time expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes them to thoſe dangerous Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations to ſin, which always ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company extreme Want. Upon theſe accounts Suretiſhip is oftner the occaſion of a great deal of
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:93273:155"/>
Injuſtice and other Wickedneſs, than the Exerciſe of Charity. And ſince theſe are the uſual Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of it, 'tis very good Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to warn men againſt it, and as proper for this Book as any whatſoever, ſince the Rules of it, as I obſerv'd juſt now, are deſign'd only for <hi>Wiſe Obſervations grounded upon Experience,</hi> which are general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly True, but are not to be taken ſo ſtrictly and rigorouſly as if they never fail'd in any one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance<note n="h" place="margin">v. <hi>Grot.</hi> in Matth. 12.30.</note>.</p>
            <p>As to what Mr. <hi>N.</hi> objects<note n="i" place="margin">Ubi ſupra.</note> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Collection of Proverbs aſcribed to <hi>Agur</hi>
               <note n="k" place="margin">Prov. 30.</note>, if I ſhould grant him that they have nothing of Inſpiration in them, I do not ſee how it prejudices the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Solomon's</hi> Proverbs at all. For <hi>Solomon's</hi> Character will go a great way to Intitle his Proverbs to Inſpiration, whereas theſe are the Sayings of an Unknown Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, who does not pretend to have been bred up in the <hi>Schools of the Prophets</hi>
               <note n="l" place="margin">See Bp. <hi>Patrick's</hi> Paraph. upon Pro. 30.3.</note>, which were look'd upon as the Nurſeries of Inſpir'd
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:93273:156"/>
Writers. I know ſome Learned Men fancy both this and the 31ſt. Chapter to be Sayings of <hi>Solomon,</hi> as well as the foregoing; but as they bring no Proof for what they ſay, ſo 'tis altogether unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able why <hi>Solomon</hi> ſhould diſgiuſe himſelf under two ſuch different Names, neither of which have the leaſt Affinity with his own. Now ſuppoſing the two laſt Chapters of the Proverbs to have been writ by Uncertain Authors, and added to <hi>Solomon's</hi> by ſome Private hand, and afterward to have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued by thoſe that Copied the Holy Writings, as we ſee <hi>Additions</hi> have been made to <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>Eſther</hi> in the <hi>Greek</hi> Bibles, and as 'tis probable the <hi>Helleniſts</hi> join'd theſe and the other <hi>Apocryphal</hi> Writings with the Canonical as early as our Saviour's time: upon this Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis, Mr. <hi>N.</hi>'s Objections againſt this part of the Proverbs fall ſhort of the Mark, and do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice the Authority of <hi>Solomon's</hi> Proverbs at all. And this Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition I think has nothing of
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:93273:157"/>
Abſurdity in it, nor can any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences be drawn from hence to weaken the Authority of the Jewiſh Canon. For if we ſhould ſuppoſe theſe two Chapters to be <hi>Apocryphal,</hi> it will neither follow that we cannot tell what is Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical and what not, nor that there may have been Additions made to Books which are all of a piece and go all under one and the ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's name. We can conclude no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from hence but this, that wherever we find a Writing, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the name of an Unknown Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor added to a Book whoſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor is known, without any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Dependance upon, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion with the Book that goes before or that comes after, in ſuch a Caſe only, 'twill follow from this Hypotheſis, that we have no Reaſon to think both thoſe Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings to be of an Equal Authority. And ſince this is the only In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that can be given in all the Old Teſtament, of a ſmall Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting made an <hi>Appendix</hi> to a greater meerly becauſe of the Affinity of
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:93273:158"/>
the Subject, whatever Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis we admit concerning theſe Two Chapters, it can be no Prejudice to any other part of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Canon, becauſe there's no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance can be given of a like nature.</p>
            <p>But whatever I have ſaid upon this Point, I propoſe only by way of Suppoſition, and meerly out of a Deſign to ſhew that whatever Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections Mr. <hi>N.</hi> thinks he can make againſt theſe <hi>Additions</hi> to the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> they do not at all diminiſh the Authority of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>'s Writings. For indeed the Authority of the Jewiſh Canon weighs ſo much with me, and the Jews ſeem to have been ſo ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of admitting any Writing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Canon, without due Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining whether it deſerv'd to be receiv'd into it or not, that I muſt confeſs I cannot eaſily bring my ſelf to think there are any <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryphals</hi> among the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the Old Teſtament. As for the <hi>Greek</hi> Writings and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlations, we know that the <hi>Helle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi> were much more Eaſie and
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:93273:158"/>
Remiſs as to this matter, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed great Liberty to Tranſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and Commentators to make ſuch Additions to the Text, which in their Opinion did tend to Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate it. But the Jews being Scrupulous of Adding to, or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhing from the Text, even to Superſtition, I think it Unjuſt to conclude that any part of their Canon is of doubtful Authority, from one ſingle Inſtance which ſome may fancy looks ſuſpicious.

               <note n="e" place="margin">Prov. 30.2.</note>. and concludes from thence that he can be a man of no Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

            <p>Our Author objects nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi> and the <hi>Canticles,</hi> but what has been Objected ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times before, and as often An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered: for which reaſon I ſhall be more Brief in Refuting him.</p>
            <p>'Tis certain that the Deſign of
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:93273:159"/>
               <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi> is to ſet forth the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Humane Life, which <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> does by ſhewing how Empty and Unſatisfactory all thoſe Ends are which men uſually propoſe to themſelves, as the greateſt Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs this World can afford: ſuch as are Knowledge<note n="f" place="margin">Eccles. 1.</note>, Pleaſure<note n="g" place="margin">Ch. 2.</note>, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Authority<note n="h" place="margin">Ch. 3. and 4.</note>, and laſtly Riches<note n="i" place="margin">Ch. 5. and 6.</note>. Further, he takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice how men's Ignorance, and the Obſcurity in which the Great and Weighty Points concerning the Immortality of the Soul, a Future State, and the Methods of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence are Involved, do occaſion a great deal of Miſery and Trouble to Mankind. Whilſt Ill men take advantage of the Difficulties which may be objected againſt theſe Truths, and from thence conclude that there's no Providence nor Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Judgment, and thereby har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den themſelves in<note n="k" place="margin">Ch. 8. 11, 14. ch. 9. 3.</note> Wickedneſs, or give themſelves up to Senſuality, and ſay, <hi>Let us eat and drink, for to morrow we ſhall die</hi>
               <note n="l" place="margin">Ch. 3. 18, &amp;c.</note>. And even good men are now and then in a great Perplexity about theſe things,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:93273:160"/>
by reaſon of the Obſcurity and Difficulties with which they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, and begin to doubt and ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in their Faith<note n="m" place="margin">Ch. 1. 13.-8. 16, 17.</note>. If men would therefore view the Scope and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the whole Book, and not take it by Piece-meal or examine each Sentence apart, they might eaſily ſee, that when the Author propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes Doubts concerning Providence and a Future State, he does not ſpeak his own Senſe: for in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral places he plainly aſſerts God's Ordering and Diſpoſing of all things<note n="n" place="margin">Ch. 3. 11, 14.-7. 13.-9. 1.-11. 5.</note>, and ſpeaks of another Life and a Future Judgment, with the greateſt Clearneſs and Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of any of the <hi>Canonical Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> of the Old Teſtament<note n="o" place="margin">Ch. 3. 17.-11. 9.-12. 7. 14.</note>. And therefore the Deſign of thoſe other places which ſeem at firſt to contradict theſe, is only to ſhew that the Obſcurity of theſe Great Articles of Faith, had often fill'd his own and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good Men's minds with Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexing thoughts, and that the Generality of Men took Incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement from thence to mind
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:93273:160"/>
only Senſual Pleaſures, and make no Conſcience of Injuring and Oppreſſing others. So that the uncertainty and Imperfection of Humane Knowledge as to theſe things, was a great Ingredient in the Vanities of Life: and one of thoſe <hi>ſore Travels which God hath given to the Sons of Men, to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed therewith</hi>
               <note n="p" place="margin">Eccles. 1.13.</note>. And we may obſerve, that when he mentions the Doubts concerning the Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of the Soul, he Introduces them with this Preface,<note n="q" place="margin">c. 3. 18.</note>

            <head>THE CONCLUSION.</head>
            <p>ANd now I have Finiſh'd my Undertaking, and have given a particular Anſwer to all the Arguments Mr. <hi>N.</hi> has advanc'd againſt the <hi>Divine Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Holy Scriptures.</hi> I have not to my Knowledge paſs'd by any thing which is of Weight in any of the Letters, nor diſſembled the True Force of any of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections contain'd in them. And upon the whole matter it appears,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:93273:162"/>
that the Main Strength of the Book may be Compriz'd in this one Argument, viz. <hi>That Book can't be of Divine Authority, nor Written by God's Direction, where there are any Marks of Humane In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, and of Men's making <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of their Natural Talents of Memory or Invention in the Compoſure.</hi> The Falſeneſs of which Aſſertion I have ſhewed in ſeveral places of the Foregoing Diſcourſe: and at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent I ſhall only make this further Remark upon it, for a Concluſion of the whole Diſcourſe; <hi>viz.</hi> That at the ſame Rate of Arguing a Man might prove that God had no Hand in Governing the Ordinary Courſe of this World by his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,</hi> nor Fitting Men for the Next by his <hi>Grace.</hi> For we ſee nothing brought to paſs in the World without the help of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Agents, and God requires Men to <hi>work out their Salvation</hi> with as much Care and Diligence, as if he gave no Grace at all. And in either Caſe 'tis very hard to Aſſign juſt how far Nature goes,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:93273:162"/>
or exactly to Define how much Second Cauſes contribute toward the Production of the Effect, and how much is to be aſcribed to God. I would not be miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, as if I thought the Writing of the Scriptures owing to God's Providence, no otherwiſe than as other common Events in the World are, or that there was no greater Degree of Divine Grace and Aſſiſtance went to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of them, than does to the making other Pious and Good Books. I hope I have made it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that theſe Books were De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd by God for <hi>the Perpetual <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe and Inſtruction of the Church, to be a Fixt Rule of Faith and Manners,</hi> and the Standard by which all other Doctrines and Practiſes are to be Tried. And then I think 'tis to Reflect both upon the Wiſdom and Goodneſs of God, to ſuppoſe that he did not Aſſiſt the Holy Writers with ſuch a Degree of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility, as was requiſite to make their Writings ſerviceable to that End. But ſtill I believe that the
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:93273:163"/>
Extraordinary and the Ordinary Means of Grace agree in this, that in both Caſes God never affords Supernatural Aſſiſtance to do that which Natural Cauſes are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to Effect of themſelves: and that his Conſtant Method is to let Natural Means go as far as they can, and then ſupply the reſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>And if Mr. <hi>N.</hi> had well conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered this, he might have ſpar'd his pains in Writing this Treatiſe. Or however Innocent his Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons might be in Writing it, yet it was not ſo Prudently done in the Editor to Publiſh it, when at the ſame time he was ſenſible<note n="a" place="margin">v.

Eng. p. 51, 54.</note> that <hi>very Ill Conſequences might be drawn from it:</hi> and he could not but think that Bad Men would greedily catch at them, and make what advantage they could of them. I am as little for an <hi>Implicit Faith,</hi> or <hi>Building Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Truths upon Falſe Principles</hi> as he or his Interpreter<note n="b" place="margin">Eng. Pref. p. 7.</note>: but yet I think a Man ought to be well Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd, and very ſure he is in the Right before he ventures to Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſettle
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:93273:163"/>
Foundations. I find the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſher himſelf is of the mind, that <hi>all Truths are not to be ſpoken at all times, eſpecially when 'tis likely they will do more Harm than Good</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">Eng. 123, 124. Fr p. 219.</note>: and therefore I wonder he ſhould ſet ſuch a value upon that which at beſt is but a Probability, (for he himſelf<note n="d" place="margin">v. Fr p. 245, 221. Eng. p. 51, 127.</note> looks upon this Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis to be no more) as to venture the Publiſhing it at the Expence of the moſt Important Truths. And tho we ſhould ſuppoſe the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Mr. <hi>N.</hi> has advanc'd in his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe to be True, yet I can't look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them to be of ſuch Importance, but that '<hi>twere better the Publick ſhould be deprived of the Advantage it might draw from the Knowledge of ſuch Truths, than to be viſibly Expos'd to the Danger of Abuſing them ſo lamentably as it will be apt to do:</hi> which the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſher tells us<note n="e" place="margin">Fr. p. 218. Eng. p. 122.</note> was the Opinion of ſeveral Learned Men concerning theſe Papers. And I don't ſee any thing that he has ſaid to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, hath force enough in it to make theſe Gentlemen alter their minds. For as to what he<note n="f" place="margin">Fr. p. 221. En. p. 126</note> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:93273:164"/>
that <hi>theſe Principles may be made uſe of to overthrow the Pretences of Libertines;</hi> tho I grant 'twere better men ſhould believe as much of the Scriptures as Mr. <hi>N.</hi> does, than none at all, yet I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it a very improper way to go about to convince Infidels of the Authority of the Bible, by telling them that ſeveral of thoſe Writings which go under that Name, are meer <hi>Fiction and Romance</hi>

               <note n="l" place="margin">Fr. p. 273. Eng. p. 96.</note>, and have <hi>Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in them very like Blaſphemies</hi>
               <note n="m" place="margin">Fr. p. 275. Eng. p. 101.</note>. Theſe and ſuch-like goodly Titles does this Author beſtow upon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of thoſe Writings which Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and the whole Chriſtian Church ever ſince, have look'd upon as the Word of God, and <hi>written for our Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi>
               <pb n="287" facs="tcp:93273:164"/>

               <hi>Inſtead of Converting Libertines, does but excite their Raillery, and confirm them in their Impiety.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At leaſt if the Publiſhers of ſuch Tracts as this, have a mind to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the World that they deſign no Harm to Religion, they ought to Publiſh them in the <hi>Learned Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,</hi> that none but Scholars may Read them. For the Publiſhing ſuch Writings in Vulgar Languages proves a ſnare to Men of Unſettled Heads and Vicious Inclinations. They have not Capacity enough to Examine the true Merits of the Cauſe, or to weigh Exactly what can be ſaid on both ſides, in ſuch Nice and Difficult Subjects: and therefore they preſently run away with any thing that ſeems to make againſt Religion, without conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering what can be ſaid on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, becauſe they are glad to find any Pretence or Plea for Sin and Wickedneſs.</p>
            <p>But if the <hi>Editor</hi> had no good reaſon for Publiſhing this Treatiſe,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:93273:165"/>
I am ſure the <hi>Tranſlator</hi> hath much leſs for Printing it in <hi>Engliſh.</hi> He himſelf<note n="o" place="margin">Engl.

But ſince he tells us theſe Diſcourſes were not deſign'd for Plain, Honeſt, Illiterate Chriſtians, I cannot imagine why they were Tranſlated, except it were, as ſome other <hi>Precious Treatiſes</hi> have been of late, for the Benefit of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt, Illiterate Atheiſts; and to furniſh thoſe <hi>Wits</hi> with Objections againſt the Scriptures, who ſet up for Advocates of Irreligion, and value themſelves for reaſoning out of the common Road, and not blindly following the Dictates of others: and yet for all their migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Boaſts, can only Repeat the Arguments which other Men put into their Mouthes, and thoſe too muſt be <hi>Conſtrued</hi> into <hi>Engliſh,</hi> before they can Underſtand them.</p>
